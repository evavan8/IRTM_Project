"Palestinian killed by Israeli military gunfire in Hebron""",5/18/21 11:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124562,"
HEBRON, Tuesday, May 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday killed a Palestinian youth near al-Karantina area in the center of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to the Health Ministry.
It said that Israeli forces gunned down Islam Ghayyad, 32, in the southern West Bank city of Hebron.
Witnesses said that the Israeli soldiers opened intensive fire towards Ghayyad, severely wounding him.
They cordoned off the area, preventing anyone from approaching the scene to identify the slain Palestinian and medics from providing treatment to him. The slain Palestinian’s body is withheld by the soldiers.
They also prevented journalists from reporting on the incident, opening fire towards them.
Israeli military claimed that the slain Palestinian purportedly attempted to carry out a shooting attack before being killed. No soldier was hurt in the alleged attack.
There were no official Palestinian information on the incident, and circumstances surrounding it remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Many Palestinians were injured or killed in similar incidents under the pretext of alleged stabbing attempts.
Israeli has been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Various international, Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations have slammed Israel’s policy of “extrajudicial killings” against Palestinians.
ideo footage for similar alleged attacks, such that of Elor Azarya’s killing of Abd al-Fattah al-Sharif, appear to disapprove Israeli military claims, showing that lethal force was used against Palestinians when they posed no immediate, life-threatening danger, and they did not even attempt to carry out any attacks.
Palestinians have always maintained that such incidents among other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 54-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Two Palestinians injured by Israeli gunfire near Salfit""",5/18/21 11:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124561,"
SALFIT, Tuesday, May 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians were injured by Israeli military gunfire as Israeli forces backed a settler assault in Burqin village, west of Salfit city, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli settlers, under the military protection, forced their way into the village to carry out attacks and vandalize property, sparking confrontations. 
The villagers attempted to fend off the settler attack, but were met with Israeli forces gunfire, resulting in injuring two young men. The casualties, who were hit by rubber-coated steel bullets, were rushed to a hospital, where their condition was reported to be moderate.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli airstrikes pummel Gaza as the onslaught enters ninth day""",5/18/21 10:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124559,"
GAZA, Tuesday, May 18, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli warplanes dawn Tuesday launched dozens of airstrikes targeting civilian buildings and infrastructure across the besieged Gaza Strip as the onslaught entered its ninth day, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the Israeli warplanes targeted a site, a civilian institution and some roads in the vicinity of Ansar Compound and al-Katiba Mosque, west of Gaza city, a house in al-Nasr neighborhood, north of the city, in the Al-Tuffah and Al-Shujaiya neighborhoods, east of the city. No casualties were reported.
He added that the warplanes launched more than fifty raids on civilian homes, sites and civilian facilities in Beit Lahiya town and in separate areas of the town of Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip, causing massive damage in the targeted places and the surrounding areas.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the overall death toll since the latest onslaught began reached 212, including 61 children, and wounded over 1400 others, mostly children and women.
The Israeli military has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on the coastal enclave, targeting what it alleged as military sites. However, the bombardment targeted and leveled multistory residential buildings, towers, houses, government institutions, media outlet offices, banks in addition to roads and other infrastructure across the strip.    
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Palestinians stage nationwide general strike as Israel relentlessly bombards Gaza""",5/18/21 09:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124558,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, May 18, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian people today are observing a nationwide general strike to protest Israel’s relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip.
The strike, which will see the closure of all economic, commercial and educational establishments in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Palestinian villages and towns in Israel, as more than 200 people, including 61 children, were killed and over 1,300 others were wounded in the intense Israeli aerial and artillery attacks on the besieged enclave.
The strike is also being observed in protest settler mob violence against Palestinians and the forcible expulsions of Palestinians from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and days of assaults against Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
The call for the strike has been backed by the various Palestinian political parties, unions, syndicates, and popular movements, which published statements in support of it and urging the Palestinian people and their members to take part in it. 
The call of the strike has also been supported by the Arab High Follow-up Committee, which called the approximately 1.6 million Palestinian citizens of Israel to observe the strike, as Palestinians in refugee camps and worldwide are also expected to take part in peaceful protests in condemnation of the Israeli aggression.
Fatah Central Committee has called on Palestinians to adhere to the strike, describing it as a “day of rage” and calling the world to confront the Israeli occupation authorities’ attempts to “ignite a religious conflict” through forced expulsions in Jerusalem.
The Palestinian national and Islamic parties coalition also released a statement in support of the strike, which will see Palestinians everywhere embodying their national unity under the Palestinian flag. 
The participants are expected to take part in mass mobilizations at various places.

GAZA, Monday, May 17, 2021 (WAFA) –  Israeli warplanes destroyed the main power lines supplying energy to the people of the Gaza Strip, leaving homes and service establishments without electricity.
The Electricity Distribution Company said in a press conference held Monday in the Shifa Medical Complex, west of Gaza City that a 'great destruction affected a wide sector of the components of the electricity distribution network as a result of the Israeli aggression, causing losses of millions of dollars. There are five main transmission lines that have been disrupted since the beginning of the aggression and carry an estimated capacity of 60 megawatts. The remaining lines are constantly disrupted and out of service due to targeting and destroying many places. ""
It stressed that the amount of available electricity from various sources amounted to approximately 107 megawatts, and the demand for energy exceeded 400 megawatts.
The company warned against stopping the power station due to the closure of the Karam Abu Salem crossing in the southeast of the Strip and the failure to allow the entry of fuel shipments needed to operate it, explaining that it had purchased a quantity of fuel from the local market to prolong the operation period by two or three days in order to obtain electricity.

JERUCHO, Monday, May 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Monday assaulted Palestinians from the village of al-Zubeidat, north of the occupied West Bank city of Jericho, according to sources.
Local sources told WAFA that the settlers attacked two people, including a doctor, and a girl, beating them.
They added that the settlers' did so under the protection of Israeli forces, who stopped a number of citizens' cars and inspected their IDs.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

RAMALLAH, Monday, May 17, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian people called for a general strike on Tuesday in protest of the ongoing Israeli onslaught on Gaza, forced expulsions from Jerusalem, and settler mob violence. 
Businesses, schools, universities and offices in the occupied territories will close as Fatah Central Committee called on people to take part in the strike in protest of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, which have killed 200 Palestinians, including 59 children and 35 women, and wounded some 1300 others, as well as against the Israeli military occupation, settler mob violence.
The committee issued a statement backing the strike and calling the world to confront the Israeli occupation authorities’ attempts to “ignite a religious conflict” through forced expulsions in Jerusalem, while stressing that there would be “neither security, nor peace, nor stability without having Jerusalem as the capital of the independent Palestinian state”.
The Lawyers Syndicate, the General Union of Teachers, and the Higher Committee of the Public Transportation, among other public unions and syndicates, issued calls backing the strike. 
The call for the strike has been supported by the Palestinian prisoners’ movement, popular movements, and political parties, as well as by the Arab High Follow-up Committee, which called the approximately 1.6 million Palestinian citizens of Israel to observe the strike.
Palestinians in the occupied territories, throughout Israel and worldwide are expected to take part in peaceful protests in condemnation of the Israeli aggression.

"Four Palestinians killed, others wounded Israeli airstrikes on Gaza""",5/17/21 14:16,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124531,"
GAZA, Monday, May 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Four Palestinians were killed and a number of others were wounded in fresh Israeli airstrikes on the besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli warplanes targeted a vehicle with a missile near the seaport, west of Gaza city, killing three Palestinians, including two who were in the vicinity.  
The warplanes also pounded several civilian houses in Beit Lahia and Jabalya towns in the northern besieged enclave, killing one and injuring a number of others, mostly children and women. 
The casualties were rushed to the Indonesian Hospital. 
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the overall death toll since the latest onslaught began reached 198, including 58 children and 35 women. At least 1,300 people have been wounded.
The Israeli military has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on the coastal enclave, targeting what it alleged as military sites. However, the bombardment targeted and leveled multistory residential buildings, towers, houses, government institutions, media outlet offices, banks in addition to roads and other infrastructure across the strip.    
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

GAZA, Monday, May 17, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli military Monday continued its relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip as the onslaught entered its eighth day, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the Israeli warplanes renewed their strikes of various locations in Jabalya and Beit Lahia towns in the northern strip, al-Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps in the central strip and Khan Younes in the south, targeting civilian houses, factories, agricultural land and infrastructure and causing massive material damage.
The heavy artillery shelling targeted a foam products factory on Salah Eddin Street, east of Jabalya, setting it aflame. Palestinian Civil Defense crews rushed to the scene and are battling to extinguish the fire. 
An Israeli drone fired a missile toward two Palestinians walking on a street, east of Deir al-Balah city, in the central strip, wounding them. They were rushed to Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital for treatment.
This came as the Israeli military conducted more than 100 airstrikes on various areas along the western part of Gaza city, targeting Ansar compound, al-Maqusi Towers, two houses including a four-storey house near al-Shifa hospital, in addition to streets in al-Rimal, Tel al-Hawa, Sheikh Ajlin and the western part of Zeitoun neighborhoods.
WAFA correspondent confirmed casualties, including women and children, without specifying the numbers. He added that medics faced difficulties reaching scenes of the airstrikes and transporting the wounded because the Israeli military had bombed many roads leading to hospitals.
The bombardment also caused substantial damage to power lines, leading to electricity cuts across large parts of Gaza city. 
The Health Ministry reported on Sunday (last updated 4:00 PM)  that a total of 188 Palestinians were killed, including 55 children and 33 women, and 1,230 others were wounded in the ongoing Israeli onslaught on Gaza.

GAZA, Sunday, May 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Twenty-seven innocent Palestinian civilians were pulled out from the rubble of the homes levelled to the ground last night by Israeli warplanes in the neighborhood of Al-Rimal in Gaza City, raising the death toll of the barbarian Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip since last week to 181. 
The number could rise as civil defense teams are searching for any more people who might be trapped under the rubble. Over 50 other civilians have also been injured in the Israeli airstrikes on the neighborhood, located on the west side of Gaza City. 
The latest Israeli airstrikes, in addition to those carried out over the past five days, have caused significant damage to infrastructure, including electricity networks and roads, cutting the geographic connection between major neighborhoods in the coastal enclave.
Entire buildings, homes and apartments were levelled to the ground by Israeli warplanes and artillery during the ongoing Israeli aggression which mainly targets the civil population.
The latest figures bring up the number of Palestinians killed since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on Gaza last week to 181, including 52 children and 31 women, and the wounded to 1200.

"Legal group obtains recordings of internal communications between Israeli Jewish extremists plotting attacks against Palestinians""",5/15/21 16:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124484,"
HAIFA, Saturday, May 15, 2021 (WAFA) - Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel said today that it obtained internal communications between Israeli Jewish extremists revealing organized, coordinated efforts to bring masses of armed individuals to cities with significant Palestinian populations to ‘kill Palestinians’ and ‘break all their bones’.
Adalah said in a statement that it is bolstering legal action in response to the failure of Israeli law enforcement to stop nationwide organized far-right Jewish mob violence targeting Palestinian citizens of Israel. Adalah is also examining Israeli police violence against Palestinian citizens.
Adalah Attorney Suhad Bishara has issued a series of four urgent letters to the Israeli attorney general and top Israeli police commanders over the past several days calling on them to act immediately to end police and Jewish mob violence and Israeli police inaction against and – in some cases – overt cooperation with or support of this mob violence.
Adalah has obtained a number of internal communications between far-right Jewish extremists that reveal their organized, coordinated efforts to bring armed men to mixed Israeli cities – such as Lod, Ramle, Acre, Haifa, and Jaffa – with significant Palestinian populations.
This series of voice messages (with English subtitles) reveals coordination between Jewish extremists planning attacks on Palestinian citizens in the Ramle-Lod area, and assuring each other that they have the backing of Israeli police forces.
This voice message (with English subtitles) reveals the number of armed Jewish extremists arriving by bus to the city of Lod from West Bank settlements, ""dying to kill Palestinians,"" and their plans for attacking a specific Palestinian neighborhood in the city that night.
This video recording (with English subtitles) shows armed Israeli Jewish extremists assembling in a parking lot, with the narrator describing the types of assault rifles they are carrying, and saying that all are welcome to join to come ""break all their bones"".
In Adalah’s most recent letter, issued this afternoon, it stressed that: Illegal decisions have been made by senior Israeli police commanders that have been ""translated into the inaction on the part of police regarding what Jewish attackers are planning and doing, as well police escorts of these groups that allows for the continued planning and commission of hate crimes against Arab citizens [The Israeli police’s] continued conduct in this manner will result in continued incitement and hate crimes under police auspices"".
Meanwhile, Adalah welcomed the strong stand and critical statement released this afternoon by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michele Bachelet, and in particular about the violence by Israeli police and organized extreme right-wing Israeli Jewish groups, including settlers, and incitement against Palestinian citizens of Israel.
Adalah highlighted Bachelet’s particular calls on the Israeli government, ""to take measures to stem the disturbing outbreak of violence between ultra-right wing groups, including Israeli settlers, and Palestinian citizens of Israel, in cities including Lod, Jaffa, Ramle and Haifa."" She raises ""particular concern [about] the apparent highly organized nature of some attacks as well as inflammatory language that may amount to incitement to racial and religious hatred and violence. Reports indicate that in some instances, settlers arrived in organized convoys from Israeli settlements in the West Bank to join local groups.""
She also raised particular ""concern at reports that Israeli police failed to intervene where Palestinian citizens of Israel were being violently attacked, and that social media is being used by ultra-right wing groups to rally people to bring ‘weapons, knives, clubs, knuckledusters’ to use against Palestinian citizens of Israel.""
Bachelet also stated that, ""There are also reports of excessive and discriminatory use of force by police against Palestinian citizens of Israel, hundreds of whom have been detained in relation to incidents of violence.""

Meanwhile, in the towns of Baita and Osrin to the south of Nablus a number of Palestinians, including an 80-year-old man suffocated as Israeli forces attacked protesters with tear gas canisters. They were treated at the scene.
Clashes were also witnessed at Huwwara military checkpoint to the south of Nablus. Medical sources said that two people with live bullet wounds to the foot were transferred to Rafidia Surgical Hospital in Nablus. At least thirty others were treated at the scene from gas inhalation.
Clashes were also reported at the northern entrance to al-Bireh city near Ramallah, leaving at least 13 Palestinians injured with rubber-coated steel bullets.
A youth was also shot and injured with a live bullet to the head. According to the ministry of health, the youth arrived at Palestine Medical Complex (PMC) in Ramallah in a very critical condition.
Another youth was admitted into the hospital with a critical bullet wound in the waist area.
Forces also attacked a demonstration to the east of Tubas with live ammunition, rubber-coated steel bullets, and stun grenades. No injuries were reported.
Three Palestinians were also shot and injured with live ammunition, and five others with rubber-coated steel bullets, during clashes that broke out near the northern entrance to Qalqilia city. Dozens were also treated for gas inhalation.
In Tulkarem, two youth were shot and injured in clashes that broke out near Israel’s apartheid wall that runs through the town of Qaffin.
Forces fired live, and rubber-coated steel bullets as well as tear gas canisters towards protesters, shooting and injuring two youth.
One of the youth was shot with a live bullet in his lower extremities which necessitated his transfer to hospital, while the other youth was struck in the head with a rubber-coated bullet and was treated at the scene. Their condition was described as moderate.
The clashes erupted in protest against the Israeli occupation’s ongoing onslaught on Gaza and to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Palestinian dispersion and expulsion from their homes and land in Palestine on May 15, 1948 in what is now known as the Nakba, or catastrophe.
The Nakba resulted in the displacement of 800,000 Palestinians out of the 1.4 million Palestinians who lived in historical Palestine in 1948 in 1,300 villages and towns. The majority of the displaced Palestinians ended up in neighboring Arab countries and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and other countries in the world. Furthermore, thousands of Palestinians – who stayed in the area controlled by the Israeli occupation in 1948 – were driven out of their homes and lands, which were seized by the occupation.

GAZA, Thursday, May 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians were killed and several others were wounded on Thursday evening in an Israeli airstrike on al-Bureij refugee camp in the central besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli warplanes struck an inhabited house in the camp, killing at least two of the family members and wounding the others.
The fatalities were evacuated to the nearby Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.
The death toll in Gaza continued to climb on the fourth consecutive day of relentless ground and aerial bombardment of Gaza that marks the largest conflagration since the 2014 Israeli onslaught on the strip.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the overall death toll since the latest onslaught began stood at least 87, including 18 children and seven women, while the number of injuries reached 530.
The Israeli military has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on the coastal enclave, targeting what it alleged as military sites. However, the bombardment targeted and leveled multistory residential buildings, towers, houses, government institutions, media outlet offices, banks in addition to roads and other infrastructure across the strip.    
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israeli police assault, detain five Jerusalemites """,5/13/21 18:42,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124442,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, May 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police today assaulted and detained at least five Palestinians from the occupied city of Jerusalem, according to local and medical sources.
Police rounded up three members of the Darwish family, including two girls, after storming and ransacking their house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya. 
Two brothers were brutally beaten up by police and settlers before being detained in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of al-Musrara. One of the detainees suffers from a foot injury, and is slated to undergo a surgery.
Meanwhile, three Palestinians sustained bruises and fractures in confrontations with the police. One of the casualties was rushed to a hospital for treatment, as confirmed by the Palestinian Red Crescent.
In Jenin district, a Palestinian was detained today afternoon after being stopped at a military checkpoint between Zababda and Qabatiya towns, south of Jenin.
Jerusalemite Palestinians recently held protests in solidarity with 40 Palestinians, including 10 children, who face forced ethnic expulsions from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood to replace them with entirely Israeli settlers. 
The Israeli Supreme Court, which could be liable for war crimes its policies supporting the dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law, postponed a ruling on the case to next Monday, which happens to also be Israel's Jerusalem Day, celebrating the occupation of East Jerusalem following the 1967 war.
Tensions have escalated in Jerusalem since the start of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with night-time clashes between police and worshippers in the East Jerusalem following the police decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions, and its decision to disconnect the power supply to the call to prayer at the mosque compound.
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque and is considered the third holiest site in Islam.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

JAFFA, Wednesday, May 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli thugs tonight attacked Palestinian Arabs and their properties in major towns inside Israel, including Jaffa and Lydda.
Videos showed Israeli attacking and vandalizing shops owned by Arabs in the port city of Jaffa in Central Israel, and in nearby Lydda.
The Israelis also attempted to vandalize mosques in both cities and attempted to set them on fire before residents clashed with them and forced them to run away.
The attack in Lydda occurred after the police have imposed a curfew on the city following last night's mass protests by the Arab residents of the city following the killing of a resident by an Israeli, which prompted residents to believe that the police were in collusion with the thugs when they allowed them to enter the city and vandalize shops and properties of the local Arab residents after curfew hours.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, May 12, 2021 (WAFA) – The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the Israeli killing on Monday of four Palestine refugee children near Beit Hanoun refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip.
All four children came from the same family, two siblings and two cousins. They were under the age of 12 and attended UNRWA schools.
They were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beit Hanoun that also led to the killing of 20 people, nine of them were children.
""Our hearts go out to their families and friends in communities that have been so cruelly affected by this latest escalation,"" said UNRWA in a press statement.
UNRWA provides critical services to more than 1.4 million Palestine refugees in Gaza and remains committed to delivering quality education to some 285,000 Palestine refugee students there. Despite the dire humanitarian conditions in the Strip, ongoing blockade and very high COVID-19 infection rates, students are still able to access an UNRWA education.
UNRWA said ""it repeats its profound concern regarding the impact of the military escalation on children by placing their lives and futures at risk. Children are and must be protected under International Law and those responsible for breaching their obligations must be held fully accountable on the basis of clear evidence. The Agency yet again appeals to all parties to exercise maximum restraint and comply with their obligations under International Law in the strictest terms, including with regard to protecting the inherent right to life of children.""

"UNRWA joins other UN entities in raising alarm over eight Sheikh Jarrah families at risk of forced eviction""",5/10/21 20:46,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124395,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, May 10, 2021 (WAFA) – The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) joined other UN entities in raising alarm over eight Sheikh Jarrah families, approximately 75 persons in total, residing in the same named neighborhood of East Jerusalem that are at risk of imminent forced eviction, placing them at heightened risk of forcible transfer.
UNRWA said in a statement that these families are Palestine refugees, who lost both their original homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict. In 1956, these refugee families moved into Sheikh Jarrah with the support of the Jordanian government and material assistance from UNRWA following their displacement. They have resided in these homes for nearly 70 years. They are now at risk of being displaced for the second time in living memory, it said.
The risk of forced eviction for these eight families in Sheikh Jarrah and for other Palestinians in East Jerusalem recently increased following an Israeli court ruling in favor of the Nahalat Shimon settler organization, which claims ownership of the land prior to the creation of the State of Israel. The Israeli Supreme Court has postponed its ruling on the planned evictions.
The situation in Sheikh Jarrah is not an isolated incident. According to publicly available information released by UN OCHA, nearly a thousand Palestinians, almost half of whom are children, are at risk of forced eviction across East Jerusalem.
In many cases in East Jerusalem, including in Sheikh Jarrah, the forced eviction of Palestinians is occurring within the context of Israeli settlement construction and expansion, illegal under international humanitarian law. Some of these are based on pre-1948 claims, while Palestine refugees are discriminatorily banned from reclaiming their properties/homes lost in West Jerusalem in 1948.
However, under international law, an occupying power may not alter the law in place at the start of the occupation. Claims brought by Israeli settler organizations following Israel’s occupation and annexation of East Jerusalem, are disputed, said UNRWA.
In the occupied Palestinian territory, strict obligations apply regarding the prohibition of forcible transfer and forced evictions under international humanitarian and international human rights law.
Forced evictions are one of the major factors contributing to the creation of a coercive environment that may leave no other choice for individuals or communities but to leave, contrary to the prohibition of forcible transfer.
UNRWA, therefore, calls upon the Israeli authorities to take all necessary measures to prevent the forced evictions of these eight Palestine refugee families in East Jerusalem and for the dignity, rights and freedoms of these individuals be upheld at all times.
It also calls on the Israeli authorities to ensure respect for the equality of Palestinians and protect them from hate speech and incitement, and joins UN calls on Israel to respect freedom of expression and assembly, including of those who are protesting against the evictions, and to exercise maximum restraint in the use of force while ensuring safety and security in East Jerusalem.

JERUSALEM, Monday, May 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers led by supremacist lawmakers and backed and protected by a large Israeli occupation police force today broke into Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, provoked the Palestinian civilian residents and attacked them, according to witnesses.
Two radical Israeli lawmakers arrived at the neighborhood in a provocative move, only a day after the Israeli High Court postponed a decision on the eviction of four Palestinian families from their homes for the benefit of the settlers, and provoked the local residents.
As the residents and supporters confronted them and the settlers that came with them, the police intervened to help the settlers and attacked the Palestinians, causing injury and arresting some.
One resident said the police attacked him when he tried to prevent the settlers from breaking into his home, injuring him in the face.
Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood has been very tense in the last weeks following concern of forcible eviction of the Palestinian residents in order to turn over their homes to Jewish settlers.

"Hundreds injured as Israeli police force Palestinians out of Al-Aqsa Mosque""",5/10/21 11:45,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124381,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, May 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police Monday morning injured hundreds of Palestinians as they violently cracked down on worshippers at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) said that its medics provided treatment to 180 Palestinians who sustained injuries from Israeli police gunfire at the mosque compound as tensions continue to soar over Israeli settler takeover of Palestinian property in Shekh Jarrah and encroachments upon the mosque compound since the start of Ramadan fasting month.
PRC added that among the injuries were one serious injury, 13 others injured from direct hits in their eyes, in addition to others who sustained light to moderate injuries from tear gas suffocation. 
The PRC medics, whom are denied access by Israeli police into the mosque compound and deliberately targeted by police, have transferred 50 injuries from Bab al-Asbat, also known as the Lions Gate, to hospitals in Jerusalem.
An immense number of policemen forced their way into the mosque compound, stationing themselves in central areas, mainly in the courtyards of the Dome of the Rock, and making their way to al-Qibli Mosque and the Bab al-Rahma prayer area, attempting to force everyone towards the exits with indiscriminate use of gunfire and tear gas.
They also stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque Director’s Office and the clinic and kicked everyone out as snipers occupied the rooftops of the buildings inside the flashpoint site.
Police arrested a number of injured Palestinians while forcing them out of the holy site through Bab al-Asbat.
Director of the Mosque, Sheikh Omar Kiswani, described the police storming as “unprecedented” while calling on the international community to bring the Israeli aggression to an end.
Witnesses confirmed that police, some mounted on horses, violently attacked hundreds of Palestinians cleared out of the mosque compound throughout the Old City, showering them with skunk water and causing a number of fainting and suffocation cases.
Despite the police crackdown, police failed to secure an intrusion into the site by extremist Jewish groups, who vowed to enter the holy compound as they mark the anniversary of the occupation of East Jerusalem in June 1967.
Palestinians in Jerusalem held protests in the recent days in solidarity with 40 Palestinians, including 10 children, who face the imminent risk of being kicked out from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood to replace them with entirely Jewish settlers.
Palestinians are expected to proceed with their protests throughout the week and into the next as they attempt to save their neighborhood.
The Israeli Supreme Court, which could be liable for war crimes its policies supporting the dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law, postponed a ruling on the case to next Monday, which happens to also be Israel's Jerusalem Day, celebrating the occupation of East Jerusalem following the 1967 war.
Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, Israeli colonial settler organisations have claimed ownership of the land in Sheikh Jarrah and have filed multiple lawsuits to evict Palestinians from the neighbourhood since 1972.
Tensions have escalated in Jerusalem since the start of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with night-time clashes between police and worshippers in the East Jerusalem following the police decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions, and its decision to disconnect the power supply to the call to prayer at the mosque compound.
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque and is considered the third holiest site in Islam.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

JERUSALEM, Monday, May 10, 2021 (WAFA) – A large Israeli police force raided this morning Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's old city and attacked Palestinian worshippers, according to witnesses.
They said the forces fired rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas canisters at the worshippers causing several cases of injuries.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said the police refused to allow its crews to enter the walled Al-Aqsa Mosque compound to evacuate the wounded.
Meanwhile, the police raid came to secure the plaza of the Muslim holy site for intrusions by extremist Jewish groups, who vowed to enter the holy compound as they mark the anniversary of the occupation of East Jerusalem in June 1967, including the historic old city and its Muslim and Christian holy places.
The Red Crescent and witnesses said the police acted violently against the worshippers who observed an all-night vigil at the Mosque as part of the worship duties during the holy fast month of Ramadan, which ends in two days.
However, as the police attempted to evacuate the compound of the Muslim worshippers for the Jewish fanatics to enter it, clashes broke out and heavy fire was used to subdue the Palestinians.
Tension has been high at Al-Aqsa Mosque and East Jerusalem in general during the month of Ramadan as Israeli police attempted to prevent Palestinians from celebrating their holy month and also as a result of attempts to forcibly evict several Palestinian families out of their homes in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in order to replace them with Israeli settlers.

The Israeli Supreme Court, which could be liable for war crimes its policies supporting the dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law, postponed a ruling on the case to next Monday, which happens to also be Israel's Jerusalem Day, celebrating the occupation of East Jerusalem following the 1967 war.
Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, Israeli colonial settler organisations have claimed ownership of the land in Sheikh Jarrah and have filed multiple lawsuits to evict Palestinians from the neighbourhood since 1972.
Tensions have escalated in Jerusalem since the start of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with night-time clashes between police and worshippers in the East Jerusalem following the police decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions, and its decision to disconnect the power supply to the call to prayer at the mosque compound.
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque and is considered the third holiest site in Islam.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

"Scores of worshipers injured for 2nd night as Israel clamps down on worshipers""",5/9/21 09:26,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124364,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, May 9, 2021 (WAFA) – At least 90 Palestinians were injured last night as Israeli occupation forces clamped down on thousands of worshipers attending or in their way to attend prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC).
Clashes erupted with the Israeli occupation forces at several locations across the Old City of Jerusalem and in the alleys leading to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. 
The forces used rubber-coated rounds, stun grenades and teargas to attack the worshipers, leaving at least 90 people wounded, of whom 30 were hospitalized. Several of the injuries were for children below 18, including a 12-month-ol toddler.
Medics were also denied access to the flashpoint Damascus Gate area to evacuate the wounded, and at least one medic was reportedly injured by Israeli fire.
In one of the incidents of the Israeli crackdown, a father and his four children were injured when Israeli police officers fired a stun grenade at them in Damascus Gate.
In Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, whose residents have been holding a vigil against imminent evictions by the occupation authorities, police attacked the protesters and physically beat up some of them, and five protesters were detained by the police.
These developments came only a day after Israeli occupation forces raided the courtyards of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and assaulted worshipers using rubber-coated rounds, teargas and stun grenades, leaving scores injured on Friday night.

Fuad al-'Amour, the coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committee in Masafer Yatta, told WAFA that a group of settlers, under the protection of Israeli forces, attacked Palestinian homes and used live ammunition against residents in the village of At-Tuwani. 
In a separate incident, settlers attacked Palestinian farmers and shepherds while tending to their lands and livestock in Khirbet al-Tuba and Maghayir al-Abeed, two locales east of Yatta area.
No injuries were reported in both incidents.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

JERUSALEM, Saturday, May 08, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police attacked today evening Palestinians present near Bab Huta, one of the gates leading to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, injuring a youth, according to witnesses.
Witnesses said Israeli police fired stun grenades towards Palestinians in the vicinity of Bab Hatta, injuring a youth and detaining another.
Police officers also arrested several worshipers and denied many others access into the compound, only a day after violent clashes erupted at the courtyards of the mosque following an Israeli police attack on innocent worshipers that left scores injured.
Meanwhile today, Israeli police set up a flying checkpoint near the town Abu Ghosh at Highway 1, which connects Jerusalem with Jaffa and north cities, and stopped dozens of buses loaded with worshipers who were on their way to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. 
Police officers reportedly asked the worshipers to go back or that they would continue the way walking on foot to reach Jerusalem, which is about seven kilometers far from the site of the checkpoint. The Israeli ban, however, was broken about an hour later when hundreds of Palestinians from Jerusalem came from the other direction and shut down the road to Israeli settlers, pressing the Israeli police to reopen the road to the worshipers who had been stuck at the checkpoint for about an hour.

JERUSALEM, Saturday, May 8, 2021 (WAFA) – At least 25 Palestinians were detained by Israeli occupation forces in the occupied capital Jerusalem in an ongoing detention campaign which started last night, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS).
The latest arrests follow a violent night which saw hundreds of Israeli police officers raid the courtyards of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and assault innocent worshipers, sparking clashes that ended up with scores of injuries among the Palestinian worshipers.
Tens of thousands of worshipers had earlier packed Islam’s third-holiest site on the final Friday of Ramadan and many stayed on to protest against Israeli plans to evict Palestinian families from their homes on land claimed by Jewish settlers in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. 
Palestinians have staged a series of sit-ins in the area in recent days denouncing Israeli orders for them to vacate their homes. Israeli occupation forces have attacked the sit-ins using skunk water, tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and shock grenades. Dozens of Palestinians have been arrested.

"Mass arrests of Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem after weeks of tense nights""",5/8/21 13:24,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124351,"


JERUSALEM, Saturday, May 8, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police rounded up today at least one dozen Palestinian youths from various neighborhoods of occupied East Jerusalem following three weeks of tense nights and confrontations between police and youths at different locations of the occupied holy city.
According to sources and initial reports, police detained 13 young Palestinians following raids at their family homes in Jerusalem’s old city, as well as Silwan, Ras al-Amoud, Isawiyya, and al-Tur neighborhoods.
The arrests came after Palestinian youths in the city first confronted police attempts to prevent them from hanging around in the evening at Damascus Gate, one of the more popular gates of the old city of Jerusalem, as part of the nightly celebration of the holy fast month of Ramadan.
Police had set up barricades to prevent the youths from sitting on the stone seats in the plaza until the youths decided to confront this police and forced the removal of the barricades following nights of heated confrontation and with their persistence to hang around Damascus Gate despite all odds.
Then there came the attempts to force out Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood after an Israeli court ruled that these homes belong to Jewish settlers, a decision strongly contested by the families and the entire neighborhood and city.
Palestinians stood in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah residents and on different nights clashed with the police and Jewish settlers who attacked the sit-ins and other solidarity acts causing several injuries and arrests.
Last night also police attacked Palestinian worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s old city following the evening and night prayers causing at least 200 injuries, many suffered loss of eye or broken bones.
As tension in the occupied city is expected to continue in the coming nights, more arrests are also expected.

"As Palestinians in Israel prepare to rally in support of Jerusalem, Arabs condemn Israeli measures in the holy city""",5/8/21 10:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124346,"


RAMALLAH, Saturday, May 8, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinians in Israel have called for demonstrations today in support of Jerusalem as Arab countries and leaders strongly condemned the latest Israeli measures and attacks against Palestinian in the occupied holy city.
The Arab Follow-Up Committee, which represents the Palestinians inside Israel, called for a mass rally today in support of Jerusalem in light of an escalation of Israeli aggression against the city’s Palestinian population including last night’s brutal attack by the police against Muslim worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s old city.
It called in a statement on the Palestinians in Israel to demonstrate today in their cities and towns and to dispatch delegations to Jerusalem, specifically Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, whose Palestinian residents are under threat of eviction to be replaced by Jewish settlers, and to Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Israeli police attacked worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest places, before and after the night prayers leading to the injury of more than 200 people, some of them suffered fractured skull and loss of eye after being hit by rubber-coated metal bullets.
""All these crimes require us to stand by our one people. We are part of the battle, and it is important that we make our voice heard today with a series of demonstrations in the different towns and intersections,” said the Arab Follow-Up Committee.
Meanwhile, Arab League Secretary General Ahmad Abul Gheit condemned the police raid at Al-Aqsa Mosque and the use of teargas, stun grenades and rubber bullets against the worshippers, stressing that the assault provokes the feelings of Muslims around the world and reflects Israel’s policy of escalation.
He called for an international intervention to put an end to the Israeli escalation, which he warned could lead to an explosion in the situation in the occupied territories.
The Arab League chief also held the Israeli government responsible for what he described as “irresponsible and dangerous escalation” by embracing the strategies of the radical settler groups.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also strongly condemned the Israeli police attack against Al-Aqsa Mosque, stressing that Israel, as the occupying power, is responsible under international law to provide protection to the civilian Palestinian population and to guarantee their right for freedom of worship.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmad Hafez also condemned in a statement attempts to evict Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem in order to replace them with Jewish settlers.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry also condemned the Israeli police attacks against Al-Aqsa Mosque, which it described in a statement at a blatant challenge to the feelings of Muslims in the world, international law, and to the most basic rules of human rights.
The Ministry blamed the Israeli occupation authorities for this dangerous escalation and the consequences it would have.

JERUSALEM, Friday, May 7, 2021 (WAFA) – At least 53 Palestinians were injured today evening as Israeli occupation police broke into the courtyards of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of occupied Jerusalem, according to witnesses.
Police officers fired rubber-coated rounds and stun grenades at hundreds of worshipers attending night prayers at the compound, injuring at least 53 of them. The injuries were reportedly focused on the eyes and heads. 23 of the wounded were moved to hospital for medical treatment, while the remainder were treated at the scene by local medics. 
Dozens of worshipers were also arrested by the attacking forces.
The police attack on the mosque compound sparked clashes with worshipers, and police shut down several gates leading to the courtyards of the mosque denying access of worshipers from outside of the compound to the holy site.
In the meantime, clashes erupted between locals and Israeli police as a group of settlers broke into an iftar banquet organized by Palestinian families facing eviction in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied Jerusalem. At least two injuries among Palestinian civilians were reported.

RAMALLAH, May 7, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities handed over today the body of slain Rehab Mohammad Hroub, a 60-year-old Palestinian woman who was shot dead by the occupation army five days ago.
Hroub’s body was released by the Israeli occupation military and handed over to her family via the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) at the entrance to the village of Husan, near Bethlehem, after being withheld since last Sunday and for no reason.
Hroub, who comes from the village of Wadi Fukin in the West Bank, was shot dead by the Israeli occupation army at Etzion junction, south of Bethlehem, on the said date. Her body has been withheld by the occupation army ever since.
Israeli occupation authorities have long been using the policy of withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers, claiming that funerals of Palestinians had provided grounds for “incitement” against Israel.
Dozens of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces are still withheld in Israeli mortuaries despite calls by human rights groups on Israel to release them.

"Occupation forces assault journalists near Jenin, smash camera""",5/7/21 16:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124340,"
JENIN, May 7, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation soldiers today assaulted a group of journalists at Salem military checkpoint and camp, northwest of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, and smashed a camera belonging to Palestine TV at the site, according to press sources.
The journalists had arrived at the scene following reports that two Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint and a third one injured, but were denied access into the site by the occupation army who also attacked some of them using teargas.
One of the journalists, Sakhr Zuwatiya, a photojournalist working for Palestine TV, said he was beaten by the soldiers who also smashed his camera. 
Earlier today, Israeli occupation forces killed two Palestinians and injured another one near Salem military camp, west of the northern West Bank city of Jenin, according to security sources.
The slain Palestinians were not identified, while the casualty, also not identified, was rushed to a hospital in the nearby city of Afula.

"Israeli forces kill two Palestinians, injure another near Jenin-district military camp""",5/7/21 13:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124336,"
JENIN, Friday, May 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today killed two Palestinians and injured another near Salem military camp, west of the northern West Bank city of Jenin, according to security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli troops opened fire towards a Palestinian vehicle in the vicinity of the camp, killing two of its passengers and critically injuring the other.
The slain Palestinians were not identified, while the casualty, also not identified, was rushed to a hospital in the Israeli city of Afula.
Soldiers prevented a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance from approaching the scene, forcing it to retreat at gunpoint, as reported by Mahmoud Sa‘di.
They also prevented journalists from reporting on the incident, firing tear gas canisters and rubber-coated steel bullets towards them.
The Israeli military said that the three Palestinians purportedly attempted to carry out a “combined shooting/stabbing attack”. No soldier was hurt in the alleged attack. 
There were no official Palestinian information on the incident, and circumstances surrounding it remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Many Palestinians were injured or killed in similar incidents under the pretext of alleged stabbing attempts.
Israeli has been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Various international, Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations have slammed Israel’s policy of “extrajudicial killings” against Palestinians.
Video footage for similar alleged attacks, such that of Elor Azarya’s killing of Abd al-Fattah al-Sharif, appear to disapprove Israeli military claims, showing that lethal force was used against Palestinians when they posed no immediate, life-threatening danger, and they did not even attempt to carry out any attacks.
Palestinians have always maintained that such incidents among other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 54-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Violent clashes erupt as Palestinians resist dispossession at Jerusalem neighborhood""",5/7/21 11:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124334,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, May 7, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police Friday overnight violently cracked down on Palestinians resisting forceful eviction and dispossession in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, according to local sources and WAFA correspondent.
They said that a sizable Israeli police forced its way into the neighborhood for the third consecutive night as Palestinians and solidarity activists gathered to break their Ramadan fasting in solidarity with 40 Palestinians, including 10 children, who face the imminent risk of being kicked out from their homes in the neighborhood to replace them with an entirely Jewish settlers.
Police, some mounted on horses, attempted to violently disperse the protestors, firing tear gas, stun grenades and skunk water towards them.
They cordoned off the neighborhood in an attempt to prevent residents from other Jerusalem neighborhoods from accessing it, beat up a number of protestors with batons and detained at least six others, including Secretary-General of Fatah Shadi Mtour.
Policemen stormed a house in the neighborhood and severely beat up his owner, inflicting bruises across his body, and detained a number of Palestinians inside. The casualty was rushed to a hospital for treatment.
As Palestinians gathered to demonstrate against the forceful eviction of dozens of residents, Israeli settlers, including Itamar Ben-Gvir, a lawmaker and an extreme follower of Meir Kahane, the late founder of the violent extremist Jewish Defense League who advocated the mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, arrived at the scene, aggravating the situation.
Ben-Gvir set up a makeshift office across the street from the Iftar meal as other settlers, who in the last few days chanted racist slogans, such as “Death to Arabs” and called for all Palestinians to be kicked out of the neighborhood, pepper-sprayed at the Iftar table.
Meanwhile, an armed settler opened fire toward a group of Palestinians in the neighborhood. No injuries were reported though.
Another settler attacked a Palestinian youth who was on his way from his workplace to his house near the neighborhood using a sharp object, wounding him.The casualty was rushed to a hospital for urgent treatment.
Palestinians are expected to proceed with their protests throughout the week and into the next as they attempt to save their neighborhood.
The Israeli Supreme Court, which could be liable for war crimes its policies supporting the dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law, postponed a ruling on the case to next Monday, which happens to also be Israel's Jerusalem Day, celebrating the occupation of East Jerusalem following the 1967 war.
The Palestinian families reiterated that they rejected any deal with the settlers, considering that it would amount to a recognition of the validity of their demands.
Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, Israeli colonial settler organisations have claimed ownership of the land in Sheikh Jarrah and have filed multiple lawsuits to evict Palestinians from the neighbourhood since 1972. 
Since the start of last year, Israeli courts have ordered the eviction of 13 Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, located less than a kilometer away from the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem.

"Israeli settlers assault Palestinian south of Hebron""",5/7/21 10:42,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124333,"
HEBRON, Friday, May 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Thursday evening assaulted a Palestinian in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron city, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committee, Fouad al-Amour, told WAFA that a group of settlers hurled stones toward a 59-year-old Palestinian who was heading back to his house in Khirbet al-Mafqara community, inflicting cuts and bruises in his hand.
The casualty was rushed to a nearby medical center for urgent treatment.
The assailants came from the illegal Israeli settlement outpost of Havat Maon.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

"Israeli Supreme Court postpones ruling on Sheikh Jarrah evictions""",5/6/21 17:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124330,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, May 6, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli Supreme Court postponed today its ruling on the eviction of several Palestinian families from the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah until May 10.
The court's decision came after it was told by Palestinian families facing eviction in Sheikh Jarrah that no compromise has been reached with Israeli settlers concerning land and house ownership claims by the latter.
The court said it would hold another hearing in the case on Monday, May 10.
Sami Irsheid, the lawyer of the families threatened with eviction in Sheikh Jarrah, said in a press conference that the court decided to hold a session on Monday to hear the appeal request submitted by the families of Sheikh Jarrah. The appeal request was submitted in the name of four families: Iskafi, Kurd, Qasim and Al-Jaouni.
He said the court will also look into another appeal request from three other families whose eviction is scheduled for the July 1.
Several protests were held across occupied Jerusalem this week after Israel’s Supreme Court ordered that the Iskafi, Kurd, Jaouni, and Qasim families - consisting of 30 adults and 10 children - evacuate their homes by Thursday in favor of colonial settler groups who claim the homes belonged to Jews before the creation of the occupying state of Israel in 1948.
On Sunday, the Supreme Court had requested that the Palestinian families at risk of eviction reach an agreement with the Israeli settlers laying claim to their homes.
However, the Palestinian families reiterated on Thursday that they rejected any deal with the settlers, considering that it would amount to a recognition of the validity of their demands.

JERUSALEM, Thursday, May 6, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinian families facing an imminent Israeli threat of eviction in the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah told the Supreme Israeli Court today that no compromise has been reached with Israeli settlers concerning land and house ownership claims by the latter.
Sami Irsheid, the lawyer of Sheikh Jarrah families, said he had submitted to the court a notification that no agreement was made with the settlers concerning their alleged ownership claims, and said the families were waiting for the court's ruling concerning the matter at any time today or later on.
He added that the families had also submitted a new request for appeal to be able to submit more data on the case in order to confirm their ownership of their land and homes in Sheikh Jarrah.
On Sunday, the Supreme Israeli Court gave four Palestinian families from from Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood until Thursday to reach a deal with Israeli Jewish settlers regarding the ownership of their homes.
The deal proposed by the court requires the Palestinian families to pay the Israeli settlers to rent their homes until the current owners pass away and then assign the properties to the settlers, not to their heirs.
On March 19, the Palestinian Authority's Jerusalem Governorate urged the international community to assume its responsibility and prevent Israel from forcibly evicting and demolishing houses of Palestinian families in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem.
""The Israeli policy of forcible displacement, home evictions and house demolition is a tool being used to push Palestinians outside their capital,"" said the Jerusalem Governorate in a statement at that time.
""Such policies against an occupied population are nothing short of War Crimes under international law, and so the international community must recognize and acknowledge this tragedy."" M.N

"Israeli navy targets fishermen offshore Gaza, destroys boat""",5/6/21 11:18,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124323,"
GAZA, Thursday, May 06, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli navy today targeted Palestinian fishermen offshore As-Sudaniya, northwest of Gaza city, destroying a boat, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the fishermen were sailing within three nautical miles when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire and water hoses toward them, causing damages to a boat and forcing them to flee for safety. No injuries were reported though.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israeli forces kill Palestinian teenager south of Nablus""",5/6/21 10:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124321,"
NABLUS, Thursday, May 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday evening killed a Palestinian teenager in Odla village, south of Nablus city, according to the Health Ministry.
It confirmed in a press statement that Said Yousef Mohammad Odeh, 16, from Odla village succumbed to his injuries after being hit by Israeli forces with live ammunition in the back.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that that Israeli military handed over Odeh’s body to its medics, who rushed it to Rafidia Governmental Hospital in Nablus.  
According to information collected by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP), Said was shot dead by Israeli forces with live ammunition around 9 p.m. near the entrance to the village. Israeli forces reportedly confronted Palestinian youth at the village entrance prior to the shooting. Said was not involved in the confrontations at the time he was shot. 
“He sustained at least two gunshot wounds. He was struck with live ammunition in the back near his right shoulder and pelvis and both bullets exited from the front,” said DCIP.
According to DCIP, a Palestinian ambulance was prevented from reaching Said for at least 15 minutes. When paramedics were finally allowed to approach the boy, he had no vital signs. He was transferred to Rafidia hospital in Nablus where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.
PRCS added that its medics also rushed to hospital another Palestinian who sustained injuries after being hit with Israeli military live ammunition in the stomach. The casualty’s health condition was described as stable. According to DCIP, Israeli troops shot the other youth “as he approached Said to provide aid”.
“Israeli forces routinely unlawfully kill Palestinian children with impunity, using intentional lethal force against Palestinian children when they pose no threat,” said Ayed Abu Eqtaish, Accountability Program Director at DCIP. “Systemic impunity has fostered a context where Israeli forces know no bounds.”

"Israeli forces blockade Nablus-district town for third consecutive day""",5/5/21 12:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124311,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, May 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today continued to blockade Aqraba town, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, for the third consecutive day, according to local sources.
They said that the Israeli soldiers sealed off the town, paralyzing the movement of the town residents and preventing them from entering or leaving purportedly as part of their active pursuit of the suspected perpetrator of a drive-by shooting, which left three settlers injured, at the northern West Bank junction of Zaatara, also known to Israeli settlers as Tapuah.
The soldiers heavily deployed around and in the town surrounded an agricultural structure, northeast of the town, and detonated one of its walls before using loudspeakers to order several people to turn themselves in.
On Tuesday, the soldiers managed to seize the vehicle, believed to be used in the shooting after it was abandoned in Aqraba and after the Palestinian villagers set it ablaze.

"Israeli forces detain 12 Palestinians from West Bank""",5/5/21 12:23,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124310,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, May 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday overnight detained at least 12 Palestinians from various parts of the West Bank, according to local and security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces rounded up five Palestinians after storming and searching the houses of their families in Hizma town, northeast of Jerusalem.
Among the five detainees were four teens, aged 16 to 18.
Meanwhile, Israeli police detained at least a Palestinian and brutally assaulted others in violent confrontations in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah on Tuesday evening.
The confrontations erupted when police officers cracked down on Palestinians and peace activists, causing a number to suffocate from tear gas and inflicting cuts in the head of a girl after assaulting her. 
Rallies have recently been intensified in solidarity with dozens of Palestinians who are at the imminent risk of forcible eviction and dispossession from their homes in the neighborhood to replace them with an entirely Jewish settlers.
In Hebron district, the sources confirmed an Israeli military raid in Dura city, southwest of Hebron, resulting in the detention of two Palestinians.
Israeli troops also forced their way into Idhna town and Hadab al-Fawwar village, west and southwest of Hebron, where they detained two others.
They also re-arrested a former prisoner after ransacking his house in As-Samu‘ town, south of the city.
In Nablus district, Israeli troops ransacked several other houses and detained a woman from Aqraba town, as stated by the town mayor Ghaleb Mayadima.
The town has been a strict siege for three consecutive days as part of an active pursuit of a number of villagers who purportedly provided assistance to the perpetrator of a drive-by shooting that left three settlers injured at the northern West Bank junction of Zaatara, also known to settlers as Tapuah, on Sunday.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

"Israeli settlers erect caravans as nucleus of colonial outpost south of Nablus""",5/5/21 10:24,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124309,"
 NABLUS, Wednesday, May 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Wednesday overnight erected a several caravans to serve as the nucleus of a new colonial outpost near Beita town, south of Nablus, according to an official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, confirmed that the settlers took advantage of the closure imposed by the Israeli military on the southern rural areas of Nablus to set up a number of mobile homes atop Jabal Sbeih (Sbeih Mountain) near the town.
The area, south of Nablus, has seen an uptick in settlers attacks since a drive-by shooting left three settlers injured at the northern West Bank junction of Zaatara, also known to settlers as Tapuah, on Sunday.
The shooting followed simmering tensions in the occupied city of Jerusalem following the Israeli police’s recent decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, and attempts to forcibly evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah.
Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
It includes arsons of property and mosques, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

"Israeli settlers set torch farmlands, attack houses south of Nablus""",5/5/21 10:12,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124308,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, May 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday evening torched Palestinian farmlands and attacked houses in Burin village, south of Nablus, according to an official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said that Israeli settlers set fire to a large tract of farmland in the eastern section of the town and attacked at least three houses.
The settlers came from Bracha, an illegal colonial settlement inhabited by hardcore fanatic Jews.
Meanwhile, a group of settlers hurled stones toward vehicles with Palestinian registration plates traveling along the Nablus-Ramallah Road, causing damage to some of them.
Burin town has been the scene of frequent settler attacks, including cutting down fully grown olive trees, setting fire to fields and crops, stealing the olive harvest, attacking olive harvesters and foreign volunteers, and hurling Molotov Cocktails toward houses in the town. 
The area, south of Nablus, has seen an uptick in settlers attacks since a drive-by shooting left three settlers injured at the northern West Bank junction of Zaatara, also known to settlers as Tapuah, on Sunday.

"Israeli forces demolish structures, seize land near Bethlehem""",5/4/21 14:05,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124305,"
BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, May 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished two structures and seized a plot of land in the southern district of Bethlehem, according to sources.
Ahmad Salah, a media activist, told WAFA that Israeli forces forced their way to the area between al-Khader town and Beit Jala city, south and west of Bethlehem, where they tore down a shack and a car wash purportedly for being built without permits.
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers seized a plot of land, located to the east of Tuqu‘ town, east of the city.
Director of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission Office in Bethlehem, Hassan Breijieh, told WAFA that the soldiers seized a donum of land in order to expand a nearby military camp at the northern entrance of the town.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration, the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank, determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

"Israeli forces detain 13 Palestinians from West Bank""",5/4/21 13:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124303,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, May 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday overnight detained at least 13 Palestinians from various parts of the West Bank, according to security and local sources.
They confirmed that Israeli police rounded up four members of the Abu Asab family after breaking into their house in Issawiya, an East Jerusalem neighborhood of some 20,000 Palestinians where residents and constantly harassed by police and anyone, including children, run the risk of arbitrary arrest. 
As they descended upon the house, the sizable police force beat up the family members, inflicting bruises and cuts across their bodies, especially in the head and face before arresting them, as confirmed by the Wadi Hilweh Information Center.
Police detained another Palestinian after storming his family house in the same neighborhood.
In Hebron district, Israeli forces barged their way into Tarqumiyah town, northwest of the city, where they detained another.
They also conducted a similar raid in the nearby town of Surif, resulting in the detention of another.
This came as a similar raid was confirmed in Beit Ummar town, north of the city, resulting in the detention of a 24-year-old university student, as reported by media activist Muhammad Awad.
The soldiers also physically assaulted a Palestinian and smashed the windshields of his vehicle in the southern part of Hebron city.
In Ramallah district, Israeli military vehicles stormed Turmus Ayya town, north of the city, where soldiers rounded up a father along his 18-year-old son.
The raid triggered confrontations during which the soldiers opened fire towards local protestors. No injuries were reported though.
In Nablus district, Israeli troops forced their way into Aqraba town, southeast of the city, where they detained three residents, including two brothers.
The Israeli army sealed off the town purportedly as part of an active pursuit of the suspected perpetrators of a drive-by shooting, which left three settlers injured, at the northern West Bank junction of Zaatara, also known to Israeli settlers as Tapuah.
Clashes broke out with the soldiers, who ransacked a number of houses, seized the recordings of their surveillance cameras and briefly held worshipers at a local mosque.
The soldiers managed to seize the vehicle, spotted outside the town, after the Palestinian villagers set it ablaze.
The drive-by shooting was followed by a series of settler attacks, including pelting vehicles with Palestinian registration plates with stones, south of Nablus and northeast of Ramallah, and assaulting a shepherd in Far'ata town, east of Qalqilya.
It also followed simmering tensions in the occupied city of Jerusalem following Israeli police’s recent decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, and attempts to forcibly evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah.

"Settlers attack Palestinians attempting to defend their land east of Hebron""",5/4/21 11:23,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124300,"
HEBRON, Tuesday, May 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday overnight attacked Palestinian landowners attempting to defend their land against takeover, east of Hebron, according to a landowner.
Aref Jaber confirmed that a group of settlers, under military protection, squatted in his plot of land, which occupies 25 donums, in al-Baq‘a area, and attempted to set up a mobile home as a means to take it over.
When Aref and other landowners attempted to confront the settlers, they were beaten up and pepper-sprayed.   
Janer said that this was not the first of its kind encroachment upon his land, which overlooks large parts of the 50-donum area, which the settlers are striving to take over for the expansion of nearby colonial settlements.
The assailants came from the nearby colonial settlement of Qiryat Arba‘.
Horizontally located some four kilometers to the east of Hebron at an altitude of 915 meters above sea level, al-Baq‘a village has a population of some 1,500, whose majority depends on agriculture and livestock rearing for livelihood.
The village occupies a total area of 1,500 donums, 150 donums of which are classified as built-up area, 600 dunams are classified as arable land, including 100 dunams cultivated with grape trees and vegetables, and 450 others classified as forests and open spaces.
The Israeli occupation authorities have seized at least 1,000 dunams during the second Intifada, including 600 donums for the construction of the section of Israel’s apartheid wall, which isolates the villages from the east and north and pushes the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
The construction of the wall resulted in the confiscation of an additional 100 donums and the destruction of some 2,000 trees.

"Israeli settlers attack Palestinian vehicles south of Nablus""",5/4/21 11:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124299,"
NABLUS, Tuesday, May 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Monday night attacked Palestinian vehicles south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, according to an official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said that a Palestinian was driving his vehicle along Road 60, close to Burin village, when a group of settlers attacked him with stones, smashing its windshields and terrorizing the passengers.
The driver, a resident of Burin, was picking up his family when they came under the settler attack.
Meanwhile, settlers from the colonial settlement of Shilo and nearby colonial outposts pelted several vehicles with stones while traveling along the same road between Turmus Ayya town, north of Ramallah, and Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya village, south of Nablus, causing damage to them. 
No injuries were reported though.
Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
It includes arsons of property and mosques, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, May 2, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces last night assaulted and dispersed dozens of Palestinian nonviolent protesters while holding a sit-in in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, in occupied Jerusalem, against an imminent threat of eviction from their homes by the occupation authorities, said witnesses.
Police officers reportedly assaulted the protesters and beat up some of them, and also asked those protesting inside the homes slated for evacuation to leave them. 
Currently, at least six out of 28 Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah are under the imminent threat of eviction from their homes to make way for a new Israeli settlement known as Shimon HaTsadiq. A plan for the settlement, consisting of 200 housing units on 18 dunums, has already been submitted to the Israeli municipality in Jerusalem.
The Jerusalem District Court has ruled at least six families must vacate their homes in Sheikh Jarrah as of today, despite living there for generations.
The same court ruled seven other families should leave their homes by August 1. In total, 58 people, including 17 children, are set to be forcibly displaced to make way for Israeli settlers.
The court rulings are a culmination of a decades-long struggle for these Palestinians to stay in their homes. In 1972, several Jewish settler organizations filed a lawsuit against the Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah, alleging the land originally belonged to Jews.
These groups, mostly funded by donors from the United States, have waged a relentless battle that resulted in the displacement of 43 Palestinians in 2002, as well as the Hanoun and Ghawi families in 2008 and the Shamasneh family in 2017.

QALQILIA, Saturday, May 01, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians were shot and injured and dozens others suffocated in the Israeli army crackdown on the weekly anti-settlements protest in the northern West Bank village of Kufr Qaddoum, according to local sources.
Sources told WAFA Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and shot teargas canisters at the protesters, who also rallied to protest Israel’s closure of the main road that connects the village of Kufr Qaddoum with the city of Nablus since 2003, shooting and injuring two youth in the back, as well as causing the suffocation of dozens others from inhaling the tear gas.
“Before 2003, the residents of Kufr Qaddum would use a shorter road to the east in order to come and go to nearby cities and villages. However, as the settlements expanded so that they overwhelmed the road, it became closed for Palestinian use, said Addameer Human rights Association.
The only alternative road is roughly six times longer than the previous route, disrupting the villagers’ ability to attend university, their jobs, and other vital aspects of their economic and social well being, noted Addameer.
“Three Palestinian deaths relating to the road’s closure occurred between 2004 and 2005,” it said. Although Kufr Qaddum’s Popular Resistance Committee took their case to the Israeli High Court in 2003, the legal status of the road remains unchanged, stressed Addameer.
After all legal appeals failed, villagers decided to organize weekly demonstrations in July 2011, a step that was met with violent suppression by Israeli forces.

"UN: 43 Palestinians detained by occupation forces in last two weeks""",5/1/21 11:57,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124266,"
RAMALLAH, Saturday, May 1, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces carried out 66 search-and-arrest operations and arrested 43 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank during the period between April 13 and 26, according to the biweekly report of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA).
In the meantime, a total of 31 Palestinians were injured by Israeli occupation forces across the West Bank. Twenty-four of them, according to the report, were wounded in demonstrations that took place in solidarity with Jerusalem protests in the cities of Tulkarm, Bethlehem and Al Bireh, and the villages of Deir Sharaf and Al Lubban ash Sharqiya. 
In addition, four Palestinians were wounded in a weekly protest against settlement activities the village of Kafr Qaddum, two in a search-and-arrest operation in Aqbet Jaber refugee camp, and one in clashes with colonial Israeli settlers accompanied by Israeli forces in At Tuwani village. Of the injuries, sixteen were treated for tear gas inhalation, six were hit by rubber bullets, five were shot with live ammunition, and four were physically assaulted. 
Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation authorities confiscated two structures in the community of Susiya, near Hebron, for lack of building permits, undermining the livelihood of a family of eight. Israeli occupation forces also bulldozed 120 Palestinian-owned olive and almond trees as well as terraces in Al Walaja, near Bethlehem, on the grounds that the area had been declared ‘state land’.
Beyond the incidents in Jerusalem city, said OCHA, perpetrators believed to be Israeli settlers injured a Palestinian civilian and damaged dozens of Palestinian-owned trees across the West Bank. The injured man was working his land when he was attacked, reportedly by a settlement security guard, near Al Khader village (Bethlehem). 
Another man was physically assaulted but not injured in Huwwara (Nablus). About 90 olive trees were damaged in four locations, over 100 dunums of seasonal crops were vandalized in three locations, and damage was reportedly caused to a house under construction, fences, retaining walls, an agricultural gate, water-related structures, and cars. 
In Wadi as Seeq (Ramallah), Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian herders, resulting in the death of two sheep. In Mughayir al Abeed, settlers stoned Palestinians, forcing them out of the area, installed two tents and occupied a cave for seven days, before Israeli forces dismantled the tents and forced them out.

RAMALLAH, Friday, April 30, 2021 (WAFA) – At least six Palestinians were injured by Israeli gunfire today during protests and subsequent clashes with the Israeli occupation forces in the villages of Beit Dajan and Kafr Qaddum in the occupied West Bank, according to witnesses.
In Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, Israeli occupation soldiers fired live bullets, rubber-coated steel rounds and stun grenades at Palestinian protesters, injuring four of them, including one by live shots, and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
The protesters were holding a weekly demonstration against the colonial Israeli settlement activities and Israel's ongoing theft of Palestinian land. The wounded were treated at the scene of the clashes by local medics.
In the meantime, at least two Palestinians were injured by the Israeli occupation forces during the weekly protest against Israeli settlement construction, which takes place every week in the village of Kafr Qaddum in the northern West Bank.
Israeli soldiers attacked the protesters by rubber-coated rounds and teargas, injuring  two people in the thigh bone and foot respectively and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation. All of the wounded were treated at the scene.
For years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, and to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

Ibrahim Hamdoun, 66, from the village of Mareeha, told WAFA that three settlers from the illegal Israeli settlement of Mevo Dotan severely beat him as he was grazing his stocking in his land, located near the illegal settlement.
Medical sources said that Hamdoun was admitted to the hospital due being severely beaten, which caused him moderate injuries, bruises and bleeding. His condition was reported to be stable.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

"EU-funded project scrubs website after involvement of Israeli settlement university revealed""",4/29/21 14:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124248,"


RAMALLAH, Thursday, April 29, 2021 (WAFA) - A European Union tax-payer funded research project has redacted or removed from its website a number of incriminating documents demonstrating involvement of illegal Israeli settlement-based Ariel University in the project, in violation of EU policy, according to a press release.
Archived copies reveal that the Horizon 2020 funded BOUNCE project removed evidence of Ariel University hosting a project dissemination event and as a “Stakeholder in Israel” in project deliverables. Additional documents listing an Ariel University professor as a project co-researcher, a “member of the Israel BOUNCE TEAM”, and as one of the “Researchers Involved in Data Collection” were also removed.
Documents remaining on the BOUNCE website have been redacted, with no indication of the revisions. An Ariel University professor’s name was removed from the list of authors of a February 2020 article, while the names of all authors, including the professor from Ariel University, were replaced with ""[Hebrew University] Dissemination Team"" on another article.
Additional scientific papers co-authored by an Ariel University professor indicate funding from the BOUNCE project.
In all cases Ariel University was falsely indicated as located in Israel.
The BOUNCE website was scrubbed following inquiries from Finnish academics, including signatories of an open letter, signed by more than 500 academics, calling on the EU to stop allowing its research programs to be used to “legitimize or otherwise sustain” Israeli academic institutions in illegal settlements.
EU guidelines and its own position and obligations under international law require that it not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT).
BOUNCE project coordinator Paula Poikonen-Saksela of Helsinki University Hospital claimed that references to Ariel University in numerous documents over several years were a “mistake” and that ""mention of Ariel University was not intended as a statement on its behalf"". Poikonen-Saksela has called on BOUNCE participant Hebrew University to “carefully avoid” citing Ariel University in the BOUNCE project.
This is not the first time Israeli project participants have involved Ariel University and other settlement entities in EU research programs.
In response to the open letter signed by more than 500 academics, the European External Action Service stated, on behalf of High Representative Josep Borrell and Commissioner for Innovation and Research Mariya Gabriel, that concerns “will be transmitted to the competent services and, if an infringement of the rules is identified, corrective measures will be taken”.
In addition, European Parliament members have asked, in a written question, how the EU Commission plans to “prevent repeated transgressions” of the EU’s obligations and position on the illegality of Israel’s settlement enterprise in EU funded research projects.
Syksy Rنsنnen, a physicist at the University of Helsinki and signatory of the open letter, said, “The EU must ensure compliance with its own funding guidelines, political positions and obligations under international law by monitoring research programs for involvement of Israeli settlement institutions. There must be accountability for those who violate the rules, in particular official Israeli project participants that involve settlement institutions like Ariel University in an EU-funded project. Simply scrubbing project websites or instructing participants to “carefully avoid” mentioning Ariel University allows a serious ongoing problem to continue.”
Human Rights Watch (HRW) has published a groundbreaking report finding that Israel is committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against the Palestinian population. HRW calls on the EU to “end the activities and funding found to directly contribute to facilitating these serious crimes” and impose “targeted sanctions against individuals and entities found to be responsible for the continued commission of grave international crimes, including apartheid and persecution.”
Ariel University was established by the Israeli military to further the occupation and annexation of Palestinian land. It is supported by the Israeli courts, the Council for Higher Education, and Israeli universities, further implicating them in Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise.
In early April, Israeli mathematician Oded Goldreich was blocked by Israel’s Education Minister, supported by Israel’s High Court, from receiving the Israel Prize over his signature on the open letter to the EU.
While the Israeli Association of University Heads denounced the education minister’s interference in the Israel Prize committee’s decision, the association announced on April 10 it would admit Ariel University as a member. The announcement caused some controversy, though Israeli universities regularly cooperate with Ariel University. The Association of University Heads represents Israeli universities before the government and Israel’s Council for Higher Education.
Opposition to establishing ties with Ariel University due to its direct involvement in Israel’s violations of international law is growing. Three preeminent European academic institutions, the University of Valencia, IRT Saint-Exupéry and the University of Florence, recently ended agreements with Ariel University.
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace recently published a paper calling on the Biden administration to restore 1970s era restrictions, removed by Trump, on US scientific funding to settlement institutions such as Ariel University.

He told WAFA that the settlers, protected by soldiers, came to an area in the north of the village in order to continue work they started two days ago to open a 2-kilometer long road for the settlers.
Village residents confronted them and were able to kick the settlers out of the land, said Amira, adding that the settlers want to seize thousands of dunums of land from Nilin and nearby Deir Qadis villages to build a settlement outpost after setting up tents and mobile homes in that area two years ago.

"Settlers set Palestinian vehicles ablaze near Jerusalem""",4/28/21 10:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124235,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, April 28, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Wednesday overnight set three Palestinian-owned vehicles ablaze near the village of Beit Iksa, northwest of the occupied West Bank city of Jerusalem, according to local sources.
They said that a group of Israeli settlers torched the vehicles, which were parked nearby the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Ramot, east of the village, spray-painted racist graffiti and smashes the window shields of other vehicles parked in the area.
The torched vehicles belonged to three residents of Beit Iksa.
During the last March, Israeli settlers set two Palestinian vehicles on fire and scrawled hate graffiti in the village.
“Price tag” refers to an underground anti-Palestinian Israeli group that routinely attacks Palestinians in the occupied territories and inside Israel.
The Israeli government still refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and considers it only as group of vandals.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

"Israeli navy injures fisherman offshore northern Gaza""",4/28/21 10:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124234,"
BEIT LAHIA, Wednesday, April 28, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy Wednesday overnight shot and injured a Palestinian fisherman offshore Beit Lahia town in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the fishermen were sailing within three nautical miles, west of the town, when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire toward them, lightly injuring one of them.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israel’s closure of the Gaza sea multiplies the suffering of the fishermen""",4/27/21 16:21,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124231,"


By Khader Zanoun
GAZA, Tuesday, April 27, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli closure of the sea in the Gaza Strip increases the suffering of the fishermen who are paying a heavy price for the practices of the Israeli occupation authorities.
Israel closed the sea since Monday and prohibited fishing until further notice in a collective punishment step of the Gaza Strip’s two million population for the firing of projectiles from Gaza into Israel over the last few days.
As a result, 60,000 people in Gaza who make their living from fishing have been affected by the arbitrary Israeli measure, according to Zakaria Bakr, head of the Fishermen Union Committees in Gaza.
""Four thousand fishermen work in the sea, in addition to 1500 others whose work is directly connected to this sector, including craftsmen, drivers, merchants, fish sellers and net sellers, as well as three or four ice factories that operate for the benefit of fishermen, which stopped their production with the closure of the sea,"" Bakr told WAFA.
He said the closure of the sea coincided with an important fishing season, and closure or reducing the fishing area always comes at the beginning of each fishing season. This leaves a grave impact on the fishermen and their families.
Bakr said Israel deliberately targets the fishing sector by limiting the fishing area, attacking fishermen and their boats while in the sea, and preventing the import of all fishing equipment.
Fisherman Munther Abu Amira, 30, said the occupation authorities “close the sea continuously and tightens the grip on the fishermen, and sometimes closes it while we are at the sea,” adding that the allowed fishing area is not sufficient.
Mahmoud Daifi, 30, from al-Shati refugee camp who supports a family of 11, said that fishing is his only profession from which he lives, and on the day he works he eats, but because of the closure, his living conditions have become difficult.
""I became responsible for my family members after my father, Khalil, was killed in an Israeli attack in 2008, and I have been practicing fishing for 13 years because there is no other work available in the Gaza Strip,"" he explained.
He added that two days ago he was at work when an Israeli navy boat approached him, threatening him to go back and started shooting at him, which forced him to rush back and leave the fishing net in the sea.
""I and a group of fishermen go out daily from six in the evening until six in the morning of the following day. At midnight the Israeli boat comes and starts to chase us. No one remains in the sea. We leave the fishing nets in the water and flee,"" said Daifi.
He pointed out that the occupation power does not want to see any Palestinian fisherman in the sea, and if he was seen, even if he is within the permitted fishing area, they come and shout at him through loudspeakers, shoot at him, and order him to leave the sea, which means he cannot continue with his work.
Daifi stressed that the fishermen need fishing tools and that not everything is available in Gaza. “I call on everyone to provide these tools for us because without them we cannot work,” he said.

"A dangerous precedent: Israeli settlers issue demolition orders to Palestinians in the Jordan Valley""",4/26/21 16:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124216,"


By Israa Gorani
TUBAS, Monday, April 26, 2021 (WAFA) - Yesterday, Sunday, in a precedent the first of its kind in the region, seven Palestinian owners of vegetable stalls in the Jordan Valley received notifications from the Israeli Settlements Council to remove their stalls.
Observers believe that this step is an implementation of the annexation plan on the ground and unleashing the Settlements Council in the Jordan Valley by granting it administrative powers and the right to act in any way it deems fit in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Ibrahim Daraghmeh, one of the stalls owners, said that he was surprised that settlers from the Settlements Council handed him written notices ordering him and other stalls owners to remove their stalls and fining them.
He told WAFA that in the past two years, the occupation soldiers have demolished their stalls twice, but this is the first time that they have received notifications from the Settlements Council. In previous times, the so-called Civil Administration, an arm of the Israeli military government, handed them the orders.
Daraghmeh explained that these stalls are all they have to earn a living for their families and demolishing them means losing their only source of livelihood.
Ahmad Fuqaha, another stall owner, explained that the members of the Settlers Council not only delivered the notifications to them in the morning, but returned in the evening and threatened them at gunpoint.
He said he has partners in the stall where he works and that three families live of it, and therefore demolishing them means losing the only source of livelihood for these families. He stressed that this is the only work that remains available for them, all residents of the Jordan Valley, after the Israeli occupation and the settlers have restricted their livelihoods to a point they could no longer work in herding, raising livestock, or in farming after closing off large areas of the Jordan Valley lands, seizing them and going after the shepherds.
Human rights activist Aref Daraghmeh confirmed that this is the first time for the Settlements Council to act individually and issue notifications that stated that these stalls are located in an area under the authority of the Settlements Council, noting that the stalls are located near the northern and central Jordan Valley villages.
He considered what happened as a process to impose a de-facto policy on the Jordan Valley in granting the right to administer the area and act in it to the Settlements Council, a step done with the complicity and planning of the occupation government since the Settlements Council is part of it and does not take any action without government consent.
Qassem Awwad, who documents Israeli violations in the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, said these notifications means that the occupation government gave powers to the Settlements Council to take administrative measures related to buildings and residents in the Jordan Valley in the interests of the settlements without any regard for the Palestinian rights, and these powers are consistent with the ambitions and plans of the settlers to take over the entire region.
This means transferring indirectly the administrative powers in these areas to the Settlements Council to be the decision-making body in Area C of the occupied West Bank, thus eliminating any opportunity for development in this area for the Palestinian citizens who have the right to the land while at the same time granting full powers over these areas to the settlers, he said.
With this step, the Israeli occupation government gives the settlers a free hand in the Jordan Valley in general, which means implementing the annexation plan on the ground by telling the settlers that they can run it as Israeli land.
The dangerous part of this step and its consequences, according to Awwad, lies in the closure of large areas of the Jordan Valley and placing them under the authority of the settlements with legislation from the occupation government, and second, which is more dangerous, is that whoever stands in the way of the settlement projects in the area will be considered to be breaking the law and will be dealt with by the Settlements Council. directly.

They said the police tonight removed all metal barricades that prevented the youths from sitting on the steps of the Damascus Gate plaza, a popular place for the youths to hang around following the night prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque during the holy fast month of Ramadan.
The police placed the barricades on the first day of Ramadan, which started on April 13, and clashed with the youths every night since then every time they attempted to sit on the step. The clashes in Jerusalem led to wider clashes throughout the occupied city and eventually spread to the outskirts and West Bank areas.
In the end, the police succumbed to the will of the Palestinians in Jerusalem and removed the barricades, opening the plaza for the city's residents after withdrawing from the area, said the witnesses.

Rimawi was detained last week at his Ramallah home. He immediately began a hunger strike in protest against his detention.
According to Zabarqa, the Israeli authorities subjected Rimawi to interrogation for his work in the media.
He said Rimawi's arrest is arbitrary and is not based on any charges, but that his arrest was related to his journalistic work, noting that the issuance of an administrative detention order confirms that, which is a flagrant violation not only of human rights but also a violation of the freedom of the press.
""For the occupation authorities to dare and arrest a journalist and interrogate him for his work in the media is a very dangerous measure aimed at all journalists and media operating in the Palestinian territories,"" said Zabarqa.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, April 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Three Palestinian youths sustained gunfire injuries early today morning during clashes with the Israeli occupation army in the village of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, to the south of Nablus city in the occupied West Bank, according to WAFA correspondent.
Army reportedly raided the village and attacked hundreds of protesters taking part in a protest against the ongoing Israeli escalation in occupied Jerusalem using live gunfire, teargas and stun grenades, injuring three of them and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
Clashes also erupted in many areas of the occupied West Bank last night against the backdrop of the ongoing Israeli daily assaults on Palestinian worshipers attending prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem, which have escalated since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan.

JERUSALEM, Saturday, April 24, 2021 (WAFA) - Clashes renewed for the third night in a row today as Israeli occupation forces attacked hundreds of Palestinian worshipers, who were gathering at Damascus Gate plaza in the old city of the occupied capital Jerusalem for the daily Taraweeh prayers of Ramadan.
Police officers attacked the worshipers using teargas canisters, stun grenades and foul-smelling water cannons, as well chased them out of the plaza. Police also physically assaulted some of the worshipers as the former attempted to forcefully evacuate the worshipers out of the area.
No serious injuries were reported, and at least one worshiper was reportedly arrested.
The old city of Jerusalem has witnessed growing tensions since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, fueled by calls by Israeli far-right terror group Lehava upon Israeli settlers to attack the Old City of Jerusalem in order to ""restore national honor"".
Clashes and protests in support of the people of Jerusalem were also reported on Saturday night in many areas of the occupied West Bank.
In Jenin, north of the West Bank, a child was injured by live gunshots by Israeli occupation forces at Al-Jalama military checkpoint, north of the city, during a protest in solidarity with the people of Jerusalem.
In the village of Deir Sharaf, west of the city of Nablus, several cases of suffocation from gas inhalation were reported as Israeli occupation forces clamped down on a similar protest. A 15-year-old minor was reportedly arrested by the occupation army.
Protests and ensuing clashes with Israeli occupation troops were also reported in the communities of Tulkarm, Al-Ram, al-Tour and other points of friction with the Israeli occupation army.

"The Jerusalem uprising rages as Palestinians take to the streets 
to protest Israeli police, settlers’ provocations""",4/24/21 11:09,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124181,"
















JERUSALEM,
Saturday, April 24, 2021 (WAFA) – The Jerusalem uprising, as it has been dubbed
(in Arabic intifadat al-Quds), raged last night in occupied Jerusalem for the
11th night in a row in protest against Israeli police and settlers’
provocations and assaults on the city’s Palestinian residents, and expanded to
reach the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian
Red Crescent said it treated 20 people injured in the clashes with police in
and around the old city of Jerusalem, four of them were transferred to
hospitals in the city while the rest were treated at the location.
It also treated
13 injuries from last night’s clashes with Israeli soldiers at Qalandia
checkpoint, north of Jerusalem, and at the DCO checkpoint, north of Ramallah,
two of them were taken to hospitals. The clashes broke out last night in
support of the Jerusalem uprising and against Israeli treatment of the
Palestinians in the holy city.
Meanwhile in the
Gaza Strip, three people were injured from Israeli army gunfire as people
gathered at the northern border fence with Israel to protest the Israeli
actions in occupied East Jerusalem.
The Jerusalem
uprising started with the advent of the holy Muslim fast month of Ramadan,
today in its 12th day, when on the first day of Ramadan Israeli police
cut off wires to loudspeakers at Al-Aqsa Mosque minarets in Jerusalem to
prevent the call for prayer that alert people to the start and end of the fast
as well as the time for prayers.
Then on that
first night, and every night after, police harassed Jerusalem residents leaving
Al-Aqsa Mosque, a main worship destination for devout Muslims during the month
of Ramadan, following the night prayers and who usually gather at Jerusalem’s
old city Damascus Gate plaza to celebrate Ramadan nights.
Police not only
harassed but also attacked and forced the hundreds of people who gathered at
the plaza to leave the area, often leaving many injuries and people detained by
police.
But this did not
deter the Palestinians from continuing to gather at Damascus Gate after each
night prayer since the start of Ramadan on April 13 when some 70,000 people
take part in the worship every night, and police continued to attack the people
and close the area with metal barricades in an effort to prevent people from
hanging around Damascus Gate, one of the main gates to the old city of
Jerusalem.
The daily police
attacks reached a climax two nights ago with also fascist Israeli members of
the Lahava terror group that advocates killing Palestinians in Jerusalem and
taking over their homes joined the police in attacking the city’s Palestinian
residents.
The Israelis,
mainly hardcore racist settlers, converged in the hundreds on Damascus Gate to
confront the Palestinians.
While police
prevented the settlers from reaching Damascus Gate to prevent to pogrom in the
city and outbreak of violent clashes, they allowed the settlers free hand and
even to set up checkpoints along police lines in other neighborhoods of
occupied East Jerusalem, such as Sheikh Jarrah and al-Tur, where settlers
joined the police in harassing and attacking the city’s Palestinian residents.
Settlers last
night and early this morning attacked Palestinian homes and property in Sheikh
Jarrah neighborhood, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at homes and cars.
One Palestinian woman was injured in the head when settlers threw rocks at a
car she was in last night.
Earlier
yesterday, police attacked and dispersed a weekly protest that takes place at
the neighborhood against Israeli plans to force-evict dozens of Palestinian
families from their homes in order to turn them over to the settlers under the
pretext the property was once owned by Jews.
As the Jerusalem
uprising raged and Israeli police crackdown intensified, Palestinians in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip took to the streets in support of their brothers
in the occupied holy city.
Palestinians
attacked last night Israeli soldiers at Qalandia and the DCO checkpoints, and
protests were also reported in other West Bank cities, such as Tulkarm in the
north and Bethlehem in the south. Palestinians also rallied in the centers of
the cities in support of Jerusalem.
In Gaza, dozens
of Palestinians gathered at the border in the north of the Gaza Strip where
they clashed with Israeli soldiers across the border. The soldiers opened fire
at the Palestinians injuring three people.
People in the
Gaza Strip also demonstrated in the cities against Israeli actions in occupied
Jerusalem, and several projectiles were fired from Gaza last night and fell in
southern Israel without causing any injury of damage.
Tension was high
in occupied East Jerusalem even before the start of the fast month of Ramadan
as Israeli police prevented Palestinians in the city from holding any activity
related to the Palestinian legislative elections planned for May 22, in which
more than 60 people of the city’s residents are running as candidates.
Israel so far
has not said that it will allow Palestinians to vote in the city, a must for
holding the elections on time.
At the same
time, Israeli police has facilitated intrusions by Jewish fanatics into Al-Aqsa
Mosque compound during the daily visit hours, while allowing them to hold
rituals in violation of the status quo and the sanctity of the holy site as a
Muslim-only worship area, provoking strong reaction from people and countries,
such as Jordan, the official custodian over the Muslim and Christian holy
places in occupied East Jerusalem.

SALFIT, Friday, April 23, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers today uprooted and destroyed 13 olive trees belonging to a Palestinian citizen in the village of Hares, near the town of Salfit in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Mayor of Hares, Omar Samara, told WAFA that a group of settlers who came from a nearby illegal Israeli settlement outpost sneaked their way into a ranch near the village, where they uprooted about 13 olive saplings belonging to Aisha Mahmoud Qasem, a local citizen.  
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities, as the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction over Israeli settlers under signed agreements.
Over 700,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

JERUSALEM, Friday, April 23, 2021 (WAFA) – Over 100 Palestinians were injured and 50 others were detained in nightly violent clashes with Israeli police and settlers amid simmering tensions surrounding the holy month of Ramadan in the occupied city of East Jerusalem.
Violent clashes broke out between extremist Israeli settlers and Palestinians after some 300 extremist Jewish settlers marched towards Damascus Gate outside the Old City of Jerusalem, shouting “Death to the Arabs” and “Arabs get out” late on Thursday.
The settler march was organized and led by Lehava, a Jewish supremacist anti-miscegenation group whose members physically assault Palestinians suspected of dating Jewish women and whose leader, Bentzi Gopstein, also expressed support for burning down churches. 
Policemen fired stun grenades, tear gas and water cannons against Palestinians who attempted to confront the settler march, and some of whom threw stones and bottles, injuring over 100 and detaining some 50 others.
The Palestinian Red Crescent sources said that at least 105 Palestinians were injured, including 22 who sustained moderate injuries and required hospital treatment. The others were treated at the scene.
The clashes spread to other parts of the occupied city of Jerusalem, including the Sheikh Jarrah, Musrara, the French Hill colonial settlement, al-Tur and Wadi al-Joz, and lasted until the early morning hours of Friday.
Meanwhile, dozens of Israeli settlers took to Highway 1, the main highway which separates West and East Jerusalem, intercepting vehicles to identify Jerusalemite Palestinians and assault them, as Israeli police did nothing to stop them.
In the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, a group of settlers attacked a Palestinian woman driving her vehicle with stones, injuring her in the head.
They also vandalized dozens of other vehicles belonging to the neighborhood residents and others displayed at a local motor show at al-Mutran Street, hurling stones at them and slashing their tires.
In Wadi al-Joz, Palestinians confronted police and settlers who stormed the neighborhood and torched the vehicle of a settler who barged his way into the neighborhood. 
Similar violent clashes erupted in al-Tur neighborhood, where a number of its residents sustained injuries and others set a settler bus which entered the neighborhood on fire.
The past ten days have seen night-time clashes between police and worshippers in the East Jerusalem, with tensions mounting over the police decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions, and its decision to disconnect the power supply to the call to prayer at the mosque compound.
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque and is considered the third holiest site in Islam.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

"Israel orders eviction of Bedouin families for military training""",4/22/21 14:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124166,"
JORDAN VALLEY, Thursday, April 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities ordered today a number of Palestinian families in the Bedouin village of Ibziq, in the northern Jordan Valley region in the occupied West Bank, to leave their homes to make way for Israeli military training in the area.
Muataz Besharat, who monitors Israeli violations in the area, told WAFA that Israeli army handed notices to a number of Bedouin families in the village ordering them to leave their homes for four days next week in order to make way for the training.
The Jordan Valley forms a third of the occupied West Bank, with 88 percent of its land classified as Area C, under full Israeli military and civil control.
Nearly 20 percent of the occupied West Bank has been declared ""firing zones"" since the 1970s, but according to the UN, some 80 percent of these areas are not in fact used for military training.
However, when military training takes place, Israel forces families to leave their homes for hours or days at a time until the drill is over.

BETHLEHEM,
Thursday, April 22, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today
approved the appropriation of a large tract of Palestinian-owned land, west of
the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to an official.

belonging to Nahalin and Husan villages, southwest and west of Bethlehem
respectively.
According to the
Israeli settlement-watch group, Peace Now, “Over the years, Israel has used a

lands, with the primary objective of establishing settlements and providing
land reserves for them.”

"Settlers storm archaeological site near Nablus""",4/21/21 10:49,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124149,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, April 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today stormed the archeological site of Sebastia, north of the West Bank city of Nablus, according to an official.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that the settlers forced their way into the site under the protection of the Israeli military, which declared the site off-limit for Palestinians.
He added that a large unit of Israeli soldiers raided the town and proceeded to close the site, preventing from Palestinians from accessing it, to make room for the settler intrusion.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

He said that seven Israeli military tanks and vehicles advanced several dozens of meters to the east of Rafah city in the southern besieged enclave, where they razed a large tract of farmland and erected earth mounds amidst a barrage of gunfire and smoke bombs.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

He added that
some of these houses are already inhabited while others are in the final stages
of construction.
Meanwhile,

They said the police, and for the sixth night in a row, attacked the people with stun grenade and sprayed them with wastewater, while pursuing some and beating them up.
The police have been attacking the Palestinians at the Damascus Gate plaza every night since the start of the holy fast month of Ramadan when people gather in the thousands at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s old city to perform the Ramadan night prayers. After people leave the Mosque, they gather and sit on the steps outside Damascus Gate before police start to disperse them by force.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, April 20, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem forced a Palestinian resident of the occupied eastern part of the city to demolish his own house under the pretext that it was built without a permit.
Amjad Ja'abees, from Jabal al-Mukabber neighborhood of East Jerusalem, tore down his house after being ordered to do so by the Israeli municipality to avoid paying exorbitant costs and fines if the municipality carries out the demolition itself.
He was given a period of five days to demolish his house, otherwise he will be fined.
Many Palestinians in the occupied city embark on demolishing their own houses to avoid paying the high costs that will be imposed on them by the Israeli municipality.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes Palestinian-owned houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.

RAMALLAH, Monday, April 19, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian Water Authority today condemned the vandalism of the main water reservoir in Asira al-Qibliya village, southwest of Nablus city.
During an inspection visit to the site of the vandalized reservoir, head of the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), Mazen Ghneim, decried the sabotage by Israeli settlers of the reservoir as “a systematic and serious violation of the basic human rights”, particularly that it resulted in depriving over 6,000 Palestinians of water, particularly during the Ramadan fasting month.
He added that the settlers came from Yitzhar, an illegal settlement inhabited by hardcore fanatic Jews, while pointing that it was not the first act of settler vandalism against the site.
He pledged that PWA would spare no effort to rehabilitate the reservoir and restore the water supply to the villagers, as he urged local and international human rights organizations to document Israeli settler and occupation authorities’ assaults and help bring perpetrators to account.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

"Israel starts construction of new settler units in northern Jordan Valley """,4/19/21 15:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124133,"
JORDAN VALLEY, Monday, April 19, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today started the construction of new colonial settler units in the northern Jordan Valley, according to an official.  
Director-General of Documentation and Publishing at the Settlement & Wall Resistance Commission, Qassem Awad, said that a number of companies started the construction of 23 new settler units in the illegal colonial settlement of Maskyot in the northern Jordan Valley.
He added that the Israeli government approved the Settlement Regional Council’s request to build these units on October 24, 2020, while pointing that this step falls within the Israeli government’s support for colonial settlement construction policy. 
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

JORDAN VALLEY, Monday, April 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today razed Palestinian-owned lands in the area of Khirbet al-Hamma Bedouin community in the northern Jordan Valley raising concern of the local Palestinian residents, according to local sources.
They said that settlers from an illegal outpost located near the Palestinian community used a bulldozer to raze the lands belonging to a Palestinian resident, as more land is expected to be razed to open roads for the settlers.
Residents are worried that the settlement outposts and the settlers are going to take control of most of the pastures they use to herd their livestock, which is their main source of income.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, April 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation police last night attacked hundreds of Palestinian worshipers as they were leaving the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound via Damascus Gate in the occupied capital Jerusalem, injured nine of them and detained one, according to witnesses.
Israeli police officers were seen firing stun grenades and teargas canisters at the worshipers and chasing them in the Damascus Gate area, while also physically assaulting some of them during the attack. Nine worshipers reportedly sustained light injuries.
The Israeli police has been banning any gatherings at the Damascus Gate area since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan five days ago, while at the same time allowing gatherings for Israeli settlers in other areas of the holy city.
The Damascus Gate area, which leads to the Old City of Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, has been a scene of frequent clashes with the Israeli police since the beginning of Ramadan, due to the multiple restrictions enforced on the entry of Palestinian worshipers to the Mosque by the Israeli occupation authorities.

BETHLEHEM, Saturday, April 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today torched dozens of years-old olive trees in the town of Beit Fajjar, south of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local official.
Hasan Breijieh, director of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Authority’s office in Bethlehem, said a group of settlers sneaked into a privately-owned Palestinian land planted with olive trees in an area north of Beit Fajjar and set the trees on fire.
He said at least 50 trees were burnt, causing serious damage to an important income-generating business for the landowner.

"Targeting of donor-funded aid to the Palestinian people more than doubled in the first quarter of 2021 - OCHA""",4/17/21 11:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124108,"


JERUSALEM, Saturday, April 17, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli targeting of donor-funded aid to the Palestinian people more than doubled in the first quarter of 2021, compared with the monthly average in 2020, according to the March report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory on West Bank demolitions and displacement.
It warned that a Jordan Valley community is at risk of mass-demolition after 29 humanitarian aid structures were handed demolition orders, and re-activation of demolition orders in al-Bustan area of Silwan in East Jerusalem also raises risk of mass displacement.
OCHA said that in March, the Israeli authorities demolished, forced people to demolish, or seized 58 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This resulted in the displacement of 81 people, including 42 children, and otherwise affected the livelihoods, or access to services, of nearly 200 others.
All the structures were located in Area C, which is under full Israeli military control, or in occupied East Jerusalem and were targeted due to a lack of building permits, which are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain.
Sixteen of the structures, all located in Area C communities, had been provided as humanitarian aid for a total value of more than 20,000 euros. Another 29 donor-funded structures, at a value of nearly 86,000 euros, were served demolition orders in Hammamat al Maleh – al-Meiteh, a Bedouin and herding community in the northern Jordan Valley, which is now facing the risk of mass-demolition.
In the first quarter of 2021, the Israeli authorities demolished, forced people to demolish, or seized at least 292 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 450 people, including 246 children. This constitutes a 121 percent increase in the targeting of structures and a 126 percent increase in people displaced, compared with the same period in 2020 (132 and 201 respectively). Also, the monthly average of structures targeted in 2021 so far (97) constitutes a 37 percent increase compared with the monthly average in all of 2020 (71).
Forty-two of the structures targeted in March were located in Area C, 24 (or 57 percent) in areas designated by the Israeli occupation authorities as closed military zones for training or ‘firing zones’. More than half of the targeted structures (23) were located in Bedouin and herding communities, including 10 structures provided as humanitarian aid. These communities are some of the most vulnerable in the West Bank, with limited access to education and health services, and to water, sanitation, and electricity infrastructure.
The practice of seizing unlicensed structures in Area C has steadily increased in recent years, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of structures targeted overall.
In March, 28 structures (67 percent of all structures targeted) in Area C were seized without prior warning. So far in 2021, 64 percent of targeted structures have been seized, more than double compared with 2020 (30 percent).
Seizure procedures do not oblige the authorities to provide prior notice, thus preventing affected people from formally objecting in advance. Seizure procedures have been characterized by the ICA Head of the Supervision Unit as “a strategic tool”.
Sixteen structures were demolished in East Jerusalem: nine were demolished by the West Jerusalem Israeli municipality and seven by the owners themselves, following the issuance of a demolition order. In one of the incidents, on 24 March, the Jerusalem Municipality, along with Israeli forces, demolished a home in Jabal al Mukabbir, displacing two households comprising seven people, including three children, one of whom was a five-day-old infant. The households had been paying fines as a penalty for lacking an Israeli-issued building permit since June 2019, approximately NIS900 a month (approximately 230 euros).
Since the beginning of 2021, nearly 50 percent of all demolitions in East Jerusalem have been carried out by the owners themselves, following the issuance of a demolition order by the Jerusalem Municipality.
In late February, the Jerusalem Municipality requested the Local Affairs Court to reactivate demolition orders against some 70 Palestinian homes in the al-Bustan area, in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem, which would lead to the displacement of up to 1,500 Palestinians. The Municipality has longstanding plans to build a touristic and archeological park on the site, but following public pressure, the demolition orders had been frozen since 2010 to allow for a solution negotiated between the Municipality and the residents.
The latter submitted alternative plans to allow them to stay in the area, all of which were rejected by the District Planning Committee, the last one in December 2020. In mid-March, the residents submitted a response to the Municipality’s request to the court, asking to freeze the demolition orders for 12 more months, to proceed with further negotiations.

"Thousands of Palestinians attend Ramadan’s first Friday in Al-Aqsa""",4/16/21 13:45,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124099,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, April 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Compared with Ramadan 2020, when the mosque was devoid of any worshipper, thousands of Palestinians today attended the prayers of the first Friday of Ramadan at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound.  
Worshippers anxious to attend the first prayer of Ramadan in Jerusalem made their way to the mosque compound, crossing military barriers as Israeli police beefed up presence around and in the city.
Since the early morning hours, the Israeli occupation authorities sealed off the checkpoints separating Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and deployed police around and across the Old City, obstructing the movement of Palestinians and their vehicles and forcing them to walk for long distances to reach the holy site. 
Inside the Old City of occupied Jerusalem, policemen set up iron barriers, inspected the identity cards of passer-by in the alleyways leading to the mosque compound, issued fines against others purportedly for not wearing face masks and briefly detained others purportedly for lacking entry permits. 
Despite all the occupation measures, thousands were able to enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque from its various gates as the Islamic Religious Endowment (Waqf) Authorities were keen to implemented safety measures to rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
This came as the so-called Israeli Civil Administration, the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank, announced that it would allow only 10,000 people from the West Bank to access the mosque, claiming that they were only those who received full vaccination against the pandemic. 
None from the besieged Gaza Strip was granted a permit to pray at the mosque. 
The past three days have seen night-time clashes between police and worshippers in the East Jerusalem, with tensions mounting over the police decision to ban people from sitting on the stairs outside Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions, and its decision to disconnect the power supply to the call to prayer at the mosque compound.
The Ramadan Friday prayers usually draw hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Muslims to the mosque compound in the past, while the coronavirus pandemic brought the prayers to halt in 2020. 
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque and is considered the third holiest site in Islam.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

"Israeli police detain eight Palestinians from Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque""",4/16/21 10:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124098,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, April 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police Friday dawn detained eight Palestinians from East Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound amid tensions surrounding the holy month of Ramadan, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that police forced their way into the southern building inside the mosque compound, known as al-Qibli Mosque, as well as into the courtyards in an attempt to force worshippers out, and detained eight.
This came as fresh clashes broke out between police and Palestinian worshippers in the Old City of Jerusalem, particularly near Bab al-Amoud, also known as Damascus Gate, after police banned people from sitting on the stairs outside the gate under the guise of implementing the coronavirus restrictions.
Police fired concussion grenades towards people to forcefully disperse them as undercover Israeli forces, known as Mista'arvim, abducted a person.
Policemen also scuffled with a group of youths near Bab al-Sahira, also known as Herod’s Gate, and dispersed them.
It was the third consecutive night of clashes.
The clashes erupted over Israeli police increased violations and provocations against the Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem, especially in and around Al-Aqsa Mosque since the beginning of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
These violations include shutting down the loudspeakers of the mosque as a means to prevent the calls for prayers in addition to preventing the entry of meals to the worshippers in the evening hours after a long day of fasting without food or water.

"Israel strikes several sites in Gaza, causes damage""",4/16/21 09:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124097,"
GAZA, Friday, April 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes today struck several sites in the besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli F-16 fighter jets fired two missiles at a site, west of Nuseirat refugee camp in the central strip, destroying and setting fire to it while causing damage to nearby property.
The warplanes also targeted a site near the destroyed Gaza International Airport, causing extensive damage to it.  
They also slammed an open agricultural land, east of Ez-Zeitoun neighborhood, southeast of Gaza city, with at least a missile, resulting in a deep hole.  
No casualties were reported in any of the airstrikes though.
Israeli military sources claimed that the strikes were carried out in retaliation to rocket firing from the strip towards southern Israel earlier Thursday evening. 
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, April 14, 2021 (WAFA) – For the second night in a row, Israeli police banned the entry of Ramadan Iftar meals to Palestinians at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's old city, and then attacked Palestinians as they were leaving the night prayers at the Mosque, according to witnesses.
They said that the police refused to allow food into the walled holy compound, which houses Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, for the worshippers who were observing the Ramadan fast in order to break their fast at sunset.
This is the second night in a row that the police would not allow meals to the people fasting at the Mosque, a tradition of the Ramadan days in Jerusalem.
Police also banned the call for night prayers at the Mosque for the second night in a row.
At the same time, as hundreds of people were leaving the Mosque following the special Ramadan night prayers and as they reached Damascus Gate, one of the main gates to the old city of Jerusalem, police attacked the Palestinians and prevented them from sitting on the stairs outside Damascus Gate.
The police fired stun grenades at the Palestinians and detained five people, said the witnesses.

"UN experts warn of rising levels of Israeli settler violence in a climate of impunity""",4/14/21 16:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124069,"
GENEVA, Wednesday, April 14, 2021) – Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank has risen markedly in recent months, with assaults and property destruction occurring in an atmosphere of impunity, UN human rights experts said today.
“We note that, in 2020, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) documented 771 incidents of settler violence causing injury to 133 Palestinians and damaging 9,646 trees and 184 vehicles mostly in the areas of Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus and Ramallah,” the experts said. “Already, during the first three months of 2021, more than 210 settler violent incidents were recorded, with one Palestinian fatality. We call upon the Israeli military and police to investigate and prosecute these violent acts with vigor and resolve.”
The experts said settler violence was predominantly ideologically motivated and primarily designed to take over land but also to intimidate and terrorize Palestinians. The violence and intimidation often prevents Palestinians from accessing and cultivating their land, and creates a coercive environment pressuring Palestinians to stay away from certain areas or even move.
“They primarily target the livelihoods of rural Palestinians, vandalizing livestock, agricultural lands, trees and homes. Besides the presence and expansion of Israeli settlements, which are intended to establish illegal claims for Israeli sovereignty, settler violence is meant to make the daily lives of Palestinians untenable,” they said.
“Similarly worrying are reports that over 70 families living in the Karm al-Ja’uni area of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem are under threat of forced eviction to make place for new settlements. Seven households have already received eviction orders and asked to vacate their homes by 2 May 2021. Such forced evictions leading to population transfers are strictly prohibited under international law,” the experts said.
The UN experts noted that settler violence continues to target pregnant women, young children and older persons. “The pattern of attacks, particularly by violent and ideologically motivated settlers consistently confirms that the boundaries of attacks on all categories of Palestinians are being erased.”
They said in one incident in southern Hebron on 13 March, a Palestinian family -- parents and their eight children – were attacked by 10 Israeli settlers, some of them armed. The injured parents were treated at a medical facility in Hebron, and the children left traumatized.
“We are deeply worried by the atmosphere of impunity in which these attacks are taking place,” the experts said. “In many cases, the Israeli military has been present, or nearby, and has not taken sufficient steps to protect the Palestinians from this violence. This amounts to a discriminatory two-tier approach to military protection and policing in the West Bank.”
The situation is particularly dire in the H2 area in Hebron, where a long-standing pattern of protracted Israeli settler violence, heavy Israeli occupation forces’ presence and undue movement restrictions to the benefit of settlers, has been inflicted on the Palestinian residents in the city.
The UN experts noted that, according to Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization, in the period between 2005-2019, 91 percent of the investigations in cases filed by Palestinians for ideologically motivated crimes, have been closed without indictments by the Israeli military. “This number is abysmal when compared to the number and nature of crimes committed by Israeli settlers and it testifies more than anything to the institutional and systematic impunity that prevails in the occupied Palestinian territory.”
The experts pointed out that international law requires the occupying power, in all circumstances, to protect the population under occupation. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates the protected population “shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats…”
“We call upon the international community to impose meaningful costs on Israel’s protracted occupation, and to demand that the occupying power halt its settlement enterprise immediately,” they said. “Palestinians must be protected from settler violence and the perpetrators must be held to account for their actions.”
The experts included Michael Lynk, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967. Balakrishnan Rajagopal, Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, and Claudia Mahler, Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons.
This statement was also endorsed by Jelena Aparac (Chair-Rapporteur), Lilian Bobea, Ravindran Daniel, Chris Kwaja, Sorcha MacLeod, Working Group on the use of mercenaries.
The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

"Journalists’ Syndicate calls for protection of journalist interrogated by Mossad in Spain """,4/14/21 12:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124064,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, April 14, 2021 (WAFA) – The Journalists’ Syndicate Tuesday called for the protection of a Palestinian journalist who was interrogated by the Israeli intelligence services on Spanish soil.
The Journalists’ Syndicate called on the Spanish government to assume its responsibilities relative to protecting and ensuring the security of Muath Hamed along with his family as well as with regards to opening an urgent and serious investigation into what happened during the interrogation at the Spanish Civil Guard’s offices in Madrid.
The syndicate said that Spain’s Civil Guard is “suspected of being complicit” with Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, in terms of allowing a Mossad agent to interrogate Hamed at its offices, which constitutes a “gross violation of international laws”, “a violation of the Spanish sovereignty” and “a threat to the journalist’s security and safety”.
It pointed that it was closely following on the details of the case in cooperation with the Union of Spanish Journalists, the Palestinian Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ministry, and the competent Spanish political and security authorities to ensure that Hamed is not subject to any harm or torture. 
Hamed, a Palestinian reporter for Al Araby TV and a freelance contributor for Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, is currently a refugee in Spain, where he lives in the city of Lemoa together with his wife and two children.
Público, a popular Spanish online newspaper, reported on Friday the case of Hamed.
On December 9, Hamed received a first telephone call by a man named Nicolás, an officer on duty at the (Spanish) Information Services of the Civil Guard, Público reported.
“Nicolás wanted to discuss Hamed’s work as a journalist, his past, and his current life in Spain. This is a standard procedure for refugees and migrants”, the newspaper added.
Thus far, Hamed was not worried that any of this is out of the ordinary.
When Hamed reached the place of the meeting in the town of Bilbao he met another officer, named Javier. “Hamed answered all the questions, explaining the reasons why he applied for asylum in Spain and describing his journey from Palestine to Europe through Turkey,” according to the paper.
“In early February, the young Palestinian journalist was summoned again by Nicolás, … this time in the (Spanish capital), Madrid.” 
When he went to one of the offices of the Civil Guard, “he was not even identified or registered.”
“Aside from Javier, this time there was another man in the room, allegedly named Omar, “who was introduced to him as a Palestinian. (Hamed, however,) immediately noticed his strong Israeli accent … and he decided to answer his questions in Hebrew.”
After Omar acknowledged he was an Israeli, Javier “left the room, leaving Muath in the hands of the supposed Mossad agent,… who threatened the Palestinian journalist and his family, saying that they will never be allowed to go back to Palestine due to one of his journalistic investigations” related to the Israeli intelligence agency.

"Former Israeli spy join settlers intrusion in Nablus’ Joseph’s Tomb""",4/13/21 12:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124060,"
NABLUS, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 (WAFA) – A former Israeli spy Tuesday overnight joined scores of settlers in storming Joseph’s Tomb in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, according to Israeli media.
Jonathan Pollard, an American who served a 30-year sentence for spying for Israel, joined a convoy of buses packed with scores of fanatic Jewish settlers who broke into the site, located in the Palestinian-controlled area, where they performed religious rituals as Israeli forces secured the road and location for them.
The site of Joseph’s Tomb is contentious. Palestinians believe the site to be the funerary monument to Sheikh Yousef Dweikat, a local religious figure, while Israeli settlers believe it belongs to the Biblical Patriarch Joseph.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Pollard, now 66, sold military secrets to Israel while working as a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy in the 1980s. He was arrested in 1985 after trying unsuccessfully to gain asylum at the Israeli Embassy in Washington and pleaded guilty. The espionage affair embarrassed Israel and tarnished its relations with the United States for years.

NABLUS, Monday, April 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers, accompanied by heavy machinery, leveled around 15 dunums of land in the village of Jaloud, south of Nablus, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said settlers from a nearby illegal settlement, bulldozed around 15 dunums of land planted with wheat in the village of Jaloud, in an apparent prelude to take over the area for the benefit of settlement expansion.
Settlers also stole large amounts of nutrient-rich red soil.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities. 
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

RAMALLAH, Monday, April 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel allowed some 3.5 tons of Palestinian post held in Jordan for three years to enter the occupied territories, today said Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh.
Speaking at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting held in Ramallah, Shtayyeh said that Israel finally allowed the post held in Jordan since 2018 to enter the West Bank.
“The mail, which has been stuck in Jordan since 2018 due to the occupation measures, was allowed in and the mail destined to Palestine coming through Queen Alia Airport will be acquired on a regular basis after being obstructed by the occupation authorities for three years,” said Shtayyeh. “The equivalent of 3.5 tons of mail that was stuck due to the occupation measures was brought in.”
In 2018, Israel also allowed in about 10 tons of postal parcels held in Jordan for eight years.

"Israeli army dismantle, seize agricultural shed in the southern west Bank """,4/11/21 18:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124037,"
BETHLEHEM, Sunday, April 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today evening dismantled and seized for the second time an agricultural shed belonging to a Palestinian resident in the town of al-Khader, south of the southern occupied West Bank district of Bethlehem, according to local activist Ahmad Salah.
The activist told WAFA Israeli forces dismantled and seized an agricultural shed located west of the town of al-Kahder, citing unpermitted construction as a pretext.
He said Israeli forces have recently been carrying out wide-scale demolition campaigns against Palestinian structures in the town.
Israel uses many pretexts to justify its demolition policy, including the pretext of building having been constructed without a building permit. However, as the Occupying Power, Israel is prohibited from demolishing the property of the protected Palestinian people unless strictly justified by military necessity. The extensive destruction of property carried out by Israel without military necessity constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may constitute a war crime, said the human rights organization, Al-Haq.
Moreover, this policy of unlawfully demolishing Palestinian buildings and structures, taken alongside many other similarly unlawful policies and actions, reveal Israel’s intention to forcibly transfer Palestinian communities from their homes. Settlement construction and expansion, exploitation of natural resources, restricting movement and access, the application of a discriminatory planning policy, and the virtual impossibility of obtaining building permits create a coercive environment for Palestinians, which amounts to direct and indirect forcible transfer, prohibited under the Fourth Geneva Convention and which may constitute a war crime and a crime against humanity, said the center.
Furthermore, having their properties demolished and destroyed, the Palestinian people are deprived of their right to develop their resources and are ultimately denied from exercising their right to self-determination, added al-Haq.

"Israeli forces kick Palestinian farmers out of their land north of Hebron """,4/11/21 17:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124036,"
HEBRON, Sunday, April 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today kicked Palestinian farmers out of their land in the town of Beit Ummar, north of Hebron, in the southern occupied West Bank, said local activist, Mohammed Awad.
Awad told WAFA Israeli forces, accompanied by a group of settlers, held a Palestinian farmer along with his family for over two hours in their 5-dunums of land before forcing them out of the land for lacking an entry permit.
Israeli forces prevented the al-Salibi family from cultivating their land, located adjacent to the Israeli settlement of Karmei Tzur, built illegally on Palestinian land to the south of Beit Ummar town, and forced them out of the land.
Forces further destroyed the iron poles placed by the family for the construction of a greenhouse.
To be noted, Palestinians whose land lies behind the separation barrier must obtain special permits – which are not easily granted and are often given to only specific family members - to enter their land.
According to the al-Haq Human Rights center, Israel imposes restrictions on Palestinian farmers who want to access the olive groves located in proximity to settlements or behind the Annexation Wall.
“Palestinian farmers are required to apply for permits in order to be allowed entry into their own lands. Palestinians are often denied permits or granted insufficient time to adequately tend their land; these restrictions often become more severe during olive harvest season,” said the center.
In addition, during the harvest season, Palestinian farmers are often subjected to harassment and attacks by Israeli settlers, including the destruction, damage, and burning of olive trees.
Israel continues to deny Palestinians their fundamental right to self-determination, including the principle of sovereignty over land and natural resources, depriving them of their means of livelihoods, in contradiction to Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), said al-Haq in a story published in November 2014.
“Under international humanitarian law and as stated in the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel has an obligation not to restrict the right to work of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT),” added the center.
“The Annexation Wall and the permit system amongst other measures and policies applied by Israel prevent Palestinians’ right to movement, which seriously impacts their livelihoods,” said al-Haq.

GAZA, Sunday, April 11, 2021 (WAFA) –  Israeli occupation forces today infiltrated into borderline Palestinian-owned lands north of Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, razing agricultural lands and randomly shooting at shepherds.
WAFA correspondent reported that three tanks and two D9 military bulldozers broke into agricultural lands east of al-Maghazi, and embarked on razing large tracts of planted lands.
In the meantime, Israeli occupation forces stationed at military watchtowers along the border fence east of al-Maghazi camp opened fire at Palestinian shepherds while they were grazing in the agricultural lands east of the camp, and forced them to leave the area.
No casualties were reported.
From time to time, Israeli occupation forces deliberately break into the border lands of Palestinian citizens in the north and east of the Strip, and prevent shepherds and farmers from accessing their lands.

Izz el-Din Nedal al-Batsh lost his eye after Israeli occupation soldiers fired a rubber-coated round directly at him. The child’s father said his son was standing inside a commercial store in the neighborhood when the bullet hit his eye.
Clashes were taking place between the Israeli occupation forces and Palestinian teenagers near the area where the child was shot by the soldiers.

"Occupation forces injure nine Palestinians in Jerusalem """,4/9/21 19:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/124016,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, April 9, 2021 (WAFA) – At least nine Palestinians, including a photojournalist, were injured today when Israeli occupation forces assaulted them while they were holding a nonviolent protest in the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. The protest was held against Israel’s plan to evict dozens of families in the neighborhood in favor of settler organizations.
Israeli police officers attacked the participants with rubber-coated rounds and physically assaulted and beat up many of them, injuring nine of them, including four by rubber-coated bullets, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC).
Palestinians have been holding protests on a weekly basis against an Israeli plan that could see dozens of families in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, mainly children and women, evicted from their homes.
In February, the Israeli District Court in Jerusalem rejected an appeal by four Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in occupied Jerusalem against their eviction from their homes for the benefit of Jewish settlers and upheld the eviction order. The court gave the four families until May 2 to implement the eviction decision.
The District Court had also refused to allow discussion of ownership of the land despite attempts by the lawyers to prove that the settlers do not own the land on which the housing project was built in 1956 by the Jordanian government and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) for the Palestinians displaced following the Israeli occupation in 1948.

HEBRON, Thursday, April 8, 2021 (WAFA) – At least six Palestinians of one family were detained today by the Israeli occupation during a raid of a building in the city of Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, according to a local official.
Rateb Jabour, a Palestinian official in charge of the popular resistance file in Hebron, told WAFA that an Israeli occupation army unit raided a building in the neighborhood of Al Bowereh, east of the city, and detained six Palestinians, including a father and his three sons.
The father was identified as Daoud Abu Sbeih, 55, and his three sons as Wa'el, 28, Na'el, 26, and Basel, 24. The other two detainees are also relatives from the extended Abu Sbeih family.

"Israeli settlers take over three buildings, plot of land in East Jerusalem’s Silwan neighborhood""",4/8/21 10:24,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123997,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, April 08, 2021 (WAFA) – More than 100 Israeli settlers protected by police took over very early this morning three buildings and a plot of land in Silwan neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, according to Wadi Hilweh Information Center.
The Silwan-based center said the settlers broke into the three buildings, which were not inhabited at the time, and the plot of land where they set up two pre-fab rooms and a stairway, as they opened a hole in the wall to one of the buildings.
The police secured the settlers’ takeover of the buildings and land and provided them with protection as they moved into them, said the center.
It said each of the buildings has four floors and their owners have claimed that they sold them to other people few months ago and that they had no idea that they would be leaked to Aterat Cohanim settlement group that is active in taking over Palestinian-owned buildings and lands in occupied East Jerusalem.
Settlers have so-far taken over 12 Palestinian-owned buildings in the heart of Silwan since 2014, said Wadi Hilweh Information Center.
While the Israeli occupation municipality refuses to allow Palestinians to build or restore their buildings in Silwan, settlers often are able to re-construct the buildings they take over and expand them with consent from the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem.
Currently hundreds of Palestinian-owned houses in different areas of Silwan, but mainly in Batn al-Hawa, Wadi Hilweh, and al-Bustan areas, are under threat of demolition by the Israeli municipality for construction without permit.
However, Palestinians believe the demolition orders are part of a large-scale Israeli ethnic cleansing scheme intended to empty Silwan of its Palestinian residents to eventually inhabit it with Israeli settlers and turn it into what it calls the City of David.

"Thousands of Israeli settlers break into Islamic shrines in a West Bank village""",4/8/21 09:16,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123995,"
SALFIT, Thursday, April 08, 2021 (WAFA) – Thousands of hardcore Israeli settlers broke late last night into Islamic shrines in the northern West Bank village of Kufl Haris where they conducted Jewish rituals, according to witnesses.
They told WAFA that the Israeli army secured the area for the settlers’ break-in, setting up checkpoints at the entrances to the village, located north of the city of Salfit, and prevented the local Palestinian residents from reaching it as the settlers flocked to the area and performed rituals.
Residents are concerned that the settlers are eventually going to take over the area and build a settlement there at the expense of its Palestinian residents.
The settlers' presence in the heart of Palestinian villages and towns often leads to confrontations between the Palestinians and the Israeli occupation forces and the chance of people getting killed or injured.

"Israeli authorities to demolish structures near Jericho""",4/7/21 14:05,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123982,"
JERICHO, Wednesday, April 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today issued orders to demolish several structures in the area of al-Jiftlik village, north of Jericho, in the Jordan Valley, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli forces handed Omar Ed‘eis a notice informing him of their intention to tear down his two residential structures and two agricultural shacks within two weeks.
Ed‘eis said that if the demolition is carried out, it will displace his large family and deprive him of his sole source of livelihood.
Horizontally located 33 kilometers to the north of Jericho, al-Jiftlik has a population of some 5,500, who predominantly depend on agriculture and livestock for their main source of livelihood. The villages occupies a total area of 185,032 dunums.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, Israel maintains full control over the village, classified as Area C, and has allowed the villagers to build within a small pocket of 972 dunams, which accounts for 0.005 of the total village area.
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to water in the area, particularly the 23 underground wells used for agriculture. Local water springs are susceptible to dryness and depletion as a result of Israel’s control over water.
The Israeli water company of Mekorot has depleted the wells and has been granted monopoly on the excavation, restoration, distribution and selling of water. In contrast, Palestinians have been forbidden from constructing new wells and restoring existing ones.
Israel has seized at least some 6,750 dunams belonging to the village for the construction of seven nearby colonial settlements, 4,550 dunums for the construction of a military base, besides to more land for opening settler-only by-pass Roads No. 90, 50, 505 and 508, and constructing colonial outposts, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

NABLUS, Wednesday, April 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Hundreds of Israeli settlers today stormed the archaeological site of Sebastia, north of Nablus city, according to a municipal source.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that hundreds of settlers forced their way into the site under the protection of the Israeli military, which declared the site off-limit for Palestinians.
He added that a large unit of Israeli soldiers raided the town and proceeded to close the site, preventing from Palestinians from accessing it, to make room for the settler intrusion.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli authorities demolish structures in Jerusalem neighborhood""",4/7/21 10:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123978,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, April 7, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today demolished several Palestinian structures in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, according to local sources.
Jameel Abul-Hummus, the owner of one of the demolished structures, said that Israeli police and municipal crews escorted bulldozers into the neighborhood, where the heavy machineries tore down his own car repair stores purportedly for being built without licenses.
He added that the machineries also tore down a car garage and two rooms belonging to Majed al-Mazra‘awi and Darwish Darwish under the same pretext.
Meanwhile, police and municipal crews harassed a number of vendors and seized their stalls at Bab al-Majles, one of the gates leading to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

RAMALLAH, Wednesday, April 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday overnight detained at least 20 Palestinians from various parts of the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS) and local sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces rounded up seven Palestinians after storming their houses in Ras Karkar village, northwest of Ramallah city.
Israeli soldiers also detained another after ransacking his house in Deir Jarir village, northeast of the city. The detainee was identified as the director-general of Friends of Down Syndrome Association, Haidar Makhu.
In Hebron district, Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committees, Rateb Jabour, said that Israeli forces barged their way into Beit Ummar town, north of the city, where they detained four Palestinians, including two former prisoners.   
The soldiers also conducted a similar raid in Yatta city, south of Hebron city, where they rounded up Fatah activist, Jihad Abu ‘Eram, and ransacked the houses of at least eight other activists, turning them upside down.
In Jerusalem district, Israeli police detained a Palestinian after searching his house in the Ras Khamis area of Shufat refugee camp, northeast of the city. 
In the northern West Bank, local sources confirmed that a former prisoner was re-arrested during an Israeli military raid in Tulkarm city.
Meanwhile, Director of the PPS Office, Muntaser Samour, confirmed an Israeli military raid in al-Yamun town, west of Jenin city, resulting in the detention of a father along his son.
Israeli military vehicles also stormed Jalbun village, east of the city, where soldiers detained another.
In addition, Director of the PPS Office in Tubas city, Kamal Bani-Odeh, said that a resident of the city was detained as he attempted to cross an Israeli military checkpoint near Tayaseer town, east of the city. 
This came as Israeli troops assaulted and detained a resident of ‘Anin village, west of the city, as he was on his way back from his workplace inside Israel to the village.
The soldiers carried out a dawn raid into the village, where they broke into and thoroughly searched the detainee’s house.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.

"Israeli settlers assault mother, baby in Hebron""",4/7/21 09:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123976,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, April 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday evening assaulted a Palestinian mother and her baby in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to local sources.
Mufeed Sharbati, a resident, said that a group of hardcore settlers physically assaulted his 23-year-old daughter and her 2-year-old baby at the Ash-Shuhada Street in the city as the latter were on their way for a family visit.  
He added that settlers instruct their children to harass Palestinians in the area, as they did with his 10-year-old son on Monday.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, April 6, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinians clashed today with Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint northwest of Jerusalem following the funeral of a man the soldiers killed earlier in a village near Ramallah.
Local sources said the soldiers fired teargas at the Palestinians who were protesting the murder of Osama Mansour, 42, earlier in the day at a checkpoint in Beir Nabala village. Several people reportedly suffocated from inhaling tear gas.
Mansour, who was shot and killed after soldiers opened fire at his car as he was heading home with his wife, who was injured but reported in moderate condition, was buried at his Biddu village, near Beir Nabala.

"Palestinian officials lash out at Israel for banning an elections-related event in occupied Jerusalem""",4/6/21 17:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123973,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, April 6, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinian officials today lashed out at Israel for banning a meeting in occupied East Jerusalem on Palestinian elections, accusing Israel of violating signed agreements.
Israeli police raided this morning a hotel in East Jerusalem and banned a meeting that was supposed to discuss the upcoming Palestinian legislative elections planned for May 22, while detaining the hotel manager and another local activist.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry and member of Fatah Central Committee, Hussein al-Sheikh, said in two separate statements that the Israeli act is a violation of agreements and the right of Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem to participate in the elections.
""This is a dangerous sign of the position of the occupying power towards the participation of Jerusalem in the elections,"" said the Foreign Ministry, describing it as ""a blatant violation of the signed agreements to which the two parties are committed to, particularly the Israeli party.""
Al-Sheikh said in a tweet that preventing the meeting in Jerusalem is ""a violation of the agreements and of the right to prepare Jerusalem to participate in the PLC (Palestinian Legislative Council) elections.""
Both called on the international community, particularly the European Union and the International Quartet, to intervene and pressure Israel to allow Palestinian elections in the occupied city.
""We call on the countries of the world to put pressure on Israel to force it to abide by the agreements signed that allow the people of Jerusalem the right to vote and run for the elections,"" said al-Sheikh.
""If the occupying power did not allow a preparatory meeting, how do we expect it to agree on conducting elections campaign, registration of candidates, and voting in occupied Jerusalem,"" wondered the Foreign Ministry, which also condemned in a separate statement Israel's arrest of a candidate from Bethlehem, saying Israel is trying to put obstacles in the way of the elections.

NABLUS, Tuesday, April 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today assaulted the mayor of the northern West Bank town of Sebastia, Mohammad Azem, when he intervened to prevent the settler from abducing a child, according to sources.
Azem told WAFA that dozens of Israeli settlers arrived at the town’s archeological site under Israeli army protection and that while they were there, they attempted to kidnap a child.
He said he immediately intervened to help the child and prevent the settlers from taking him when he was beaten by the settlers despite the presence of the soldiers who did not intervene to stop them.
Israeli settlers have recently intensified their presence at the Palestinian archeological site as the army closes the area for the Palestinian residents, who fear the settlers want to eventually take over the site and establish a settlement in the area.

"Foreign Ministry denounces Israeli army killing of Palestinian man as extrajudicial execution""",4/6/21 12:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123968,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, April 6, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates today denounced the Israeli army killing of a Palestinian man near Ramallah and injuring his wife, describing the shooting as an extrajudicial execution.
Osama Mansour, 42, from the village of Biddu, near Ramallah, was shot in the head and killed early this morning when Israeli soldiers opened fire at a car he was driving with his wife after they had stopped at an army flying checkpoint. The wife, who was injured, said they stopped at the checkpoint and then continued on the road after a soldier told them to go before they were shot at for no reason.
“This atrocious crime is just one in a long and ongoing series of extrajudicial executions committed by the Israeli occupation soldiers and officers who are deployed at roadblocks and intersections in Palestinian cities and towns,” said the Foreign Ministry in a statement, accusing the Israeli government of making it easy for its soldiers to shoot with the aim of killing Palestinians in cold blood even though they do not pose a threat to them.
It called on the international community to look seriously into imposing sanctions on the occupying state or send a team to investigate the killing of Mansour.
It also called for international protection of the Palestinian people under occupation against the crimes of the Israeli forces and settlers.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, April 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police today raided a hotel in occupied East Jerusalem to suppress an event on Palestinian elections and detained two Palestinians, including the hotel manager, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli police cordoned the Ambassador Hotel in Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, denying access to it as a means to prevent a meeting on the upcoming Palestinian general elections.
The meeting, called for by the civil society organizations in the city, was slated to be held under the title “International Law Guarantees our Right to Vote”.
Police detained Secretary-General of Fatah in Jerusalem Adel Abu Zneid, the hotel manager Sami Abu-Dayyeh, and summoned two others, including Fatah activist Awad Salaymeh, for interrogation.
The Palestinians insist on holding elections planned for May 22 also in occupied East Jerusalem, as was the case in the previous two elections in 1996 and 2006, and have asked the international community to pressure Israel to allow the 300,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem to take part and vote in polling stations in the city.
So far, Israel did not respond to international mediation to allow elections in the occupied part of the holy city.

RAMALLAH, Tuesday, April 06, 2021 (WAFA) – The wife of a Palestinian man shot and killed early this morning by Israeli army gunfire near the village of Beir Nabala, northwest of occupied Jerusalem, said that the soldiers opened fire at their car after they were told at a checkpoint to proceed on the road.
Osama Mansour, 42, from the village of Biddu, near Beir Nabala, was shot in the head with a live bullet and died upon arrival at a hospital in Ramallah, while his wife, who was also shot in the back, was reported in stable condition.
The Israeli army claimed in a statement that soldiers opened fire at a car after it stopped at a flying checkpoint set up in Beir Nabala and then sped away in the direction of nearby soldiers, prompting the shooting at the car.
“We were returning home when we saw two army jeeps. They told us and other cars who were there to stop and turn off the car. We stopped and turned off the car as they said,” Mansour’s wife told Palestine TV.
“Then he (the soldier) looked at us and said go on. So we turned on the car and left when they started to shoot at us with live bullets. My husband fell in my lap. He asked me if I was hit and then was quiet. He was dead,” she said.

NABLUS, Monday, April 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today placed two mobile homes on lands belonging to the Palestinian village of Asira al-Qibliya, south of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, as a prelude for expanding the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors the Israeli colonial settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers placed two mobile homes on the land of Asira al-Qibliya village, located adjacent to the illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar.
The placement of mobile homes on Palestinian land is normally a prelude for building a settlement outpost that will eventually grow into a full-fledged settlement with Israeli government consent. This step entails seizing thousands of dunums of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.

BETHLEHEM, Monday, April 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today re-erected two tents on a plot of Palestinian-owned land in the town of Taqou, to the east of Bethlehem, which is usually a prelude to taking it over, according to local sources.
Tayseer Abu Mufreh, director at Taqou municipality, told WAFA that Israeli settlers, protected by the occupation army, re-erected two tents on a plot of land after they were removed by the owners of the land a week ago.
He pointed out that this measure comes as a prelude to seizing the land for the construction of a new colonial settlement there, which would prevent Palestinian landowners' access to their lands.

"Israeli occupation forces storm northern Jordan Valley community, take pictures of tents""",4/5/21 11:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123951,"
JORDAN VALLEY, Monday, April 5, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today stormed the northern Jordan Valley community of Humsa al-Fouqa, southeast of Tubas, and took pictures of the residents’ tents, which is usually a prelude to a demolition raid, according to a local activist.
Mutaz Bisharat, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in Tubas governorate, said staff of the so-called Israeli Civil Administration, an arm of the military government, broke into the community, demolished five times in recent weeks and then rebuilt, and took pictures of all the new tents set up by the residents to shelter them.
The Humsa Bedouin community was erased five times in the last few weeks in an effort by Israel to remove the small community from that area. However, after every demolition, residents and activists, with international assistance, rebuilt the community.
Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, during a visit to the community, described the demolitions and targeting of its residents as an “organized state terrorism which involves ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population.”
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the area of the occupied West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley in violation of international law.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967 and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.

GAZA, Monday, April 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy today targeted Palestinian fishing boats sailing off the northern Gaza coast forcing them to end their work and return to shore, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said the fishermen were sailing within the allowed three nautical miles when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire towards them.
The fishermen had to leave the water and abruptly end their fishing mission, which is their sole source of livelihood. No injuries were reported though.
Gaza, and its two million impoverished and devastated population, has been under a strict Israeli air, land and sea blockade since 2006, a year after Israel’s disengagement from the sea enclave, and suffered three devastating Israeli wars against it since then, the latest was in 2014, which destroyed its infrastructure, economy, and thousands of buildings.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, April 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today forced a Palestinian citizen to demolish his own house in the neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukabbir in occupied Jerusalem, under the pretext of lacking a construction permit, according to local sources.
Amer Shkerat, a citizen of Jabal al-Mukabbir, embarked on tearing down his own house in the neighborhood to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Israeli-run Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition on its own.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal Jewish-only settlements in East Jerusalem for with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

NAZARETH, Sunday, April 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today demolished an Arab-owned house in the city of Lob in the 1948-occupied land, under the pretext that it was built without a permit, according to Arab 48 website.
The house belongs to the Arab family of an-Naqib in the city, one of the indigenous Arab families that remained in the city following the Nakba (catastrophe) of 1948.
Israeli authorities continue to demolish Arab establishments and homes in the 1948-occupied land despite a recent announcement on freezing the amendment of ""Article 116 A"" of the Israeli Planning and Construction Law.
Houses and structures in Israel's Arab cities and towns are a frequent target for demolitions as the Israeli occupation authorities make it very difficult for Arab citizens to obtain building permits.
Currently, thousands of Palestinian-owned homes in Israel are scheduled for demolition, with many accusing the government of selectively carrying out demolitions in Israel’s Arab communities.

"Settlers uproot, vandalize scores of olive trees near Nablus""",4/4/21 11:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123942,"
NABLUS, Sunday, April 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers today uprooted and destroyed scores of olive saplings for Palestinian farmers in the village of Qusra, near the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Mayor of Qusra, Emad Hasan, told WAFA that a group of settlers who came from the illegal settlement outpost of Esh Kodesh sneaked their way into a ranch near the village, where they uprooted about 100 olive saplings belonging to two local Palestinian villagers. The two landowners were identified as Jawad Hasan and Abdulazim Abulafi.
He said this was the second attack on Palestinian property by Israeli settlers in less than two days. A video released by rights group showed Israeli settlers pelting a Palestinian man with stones in the nearby village of Jalud.
The attack happened Saturday afternoon near the village of Jalud in the northern West Bank on a plot of land near the Palestinian man’s house, according to Yesh Din, a left-wing rights group that documents settler violence in the West Bank.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities, as the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction over Israeli settlers under signed agreements.
Over 700,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

NABLUS, Saturday, April 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today attacked Palestinian farmers in the village of Jaloud to the south of Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA settlers from the nearby Aish Kodesh, an illegal settlement built on land of the Palestinian village of Jaloud, assaulted farmers at gunpoint and prevented them from cultivating their land.
He said settlers beat up an elderly man while Israeli soldiers stood idly by and provided protection to settlers. Settlers further destroyed a number of electricity poles placed along the road between the towns of Jaloud and nearby Qasra. 
Israeli settlers’ vandalism in the occupied West Bank is routine and is done with full backing by the Israeli authorities, said the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.
“Settler violence and vandalism take place with full backing by the Israeli authorities. Sometimes soldiers take part in the assault; at other times, they stand idly by. The police makes no substantial effort to investigate the incidents, nor takes measures to prevent them or stop them in real time,” it said.
Israel benefits from the repercussions, as settler violence has gradually dispossessed Palestinians of more and more areas in the West Bank, paving the way for a state takeover of land and resources, said B’Tselem.

Tuwwaneh and Masafer Yatta are located in what has been classified as Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military control. Their Palestinian Bedouin residents are continuously harassed by the army and Israeli settlers in an effort to force them to leave the area.

JERUSALEM, Thursday, April 1, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities continue to forbid Palestinian families in occupied East Jerusalem from celebrating and enjoying the release of their sons after spending years in prison and threaten to re-arrest the freed prisoner.
In the latest such incident, the Israeli authorities yesterday broke into the home of Palestinian prisoner, Ghazi Kanaan, 48, in Ras al-Amoud neighborhood of East Jerusalem and threatened to re-arrest him if his family holds any celebrations for his release on the next day.
Local sources said Kanaan was release today after completing 11 years in Israeli jails for resisting its occupation.
Israeli occupation forces, earlier this week, raided the East Jerusalem home of another Palestinian released from prison after serving 20 years behind bars, attacked people who gathered there to celebrate his release, and re-arrested the former prisoner, Majd Barbar, but released him the next day after ordering him not to hold any homecoming celebrations for him.
Celebrations are usually spontaneous as relatives, neighbors and friends of the prisoner converge on his home to greet and welcome him home, and often turns into a homecoming party.
Israeli forces then raid the neighborhood and home of the released prisoner and beat people up as they disperse them and seize pictures, posters and placards welcoming the prisoner, and Palestinian flags displayed in the area.

Director of the PPS office in Tubas, Kamal Bani Odeh, said that Israeli occupation forces opened fire toward a local resident and injured him with two bullets in the chest during a raid of Tubas. He was taken to hospital, where medics described his condition as stable.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian was injured from Israeli military gunfire as scores of fanatic Israeli settlers barged their way into Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus city.
Israeli forces escorted a convoy of buses packed with fanatic Jewish settlers into the site, located in the Palestinian-controlled area, sparking confrontations with the local residents.
The soldiers opened fire on the Palestinians who attempted to block the settlers’ access to the site, injuring one with a rubber-coated steel bullet in the head. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

"Israeli forces seal off archaeological site near Nablus """,3/31/21 11:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123894,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today sealed off the archeological site of Sebastia, north of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, for the second consecutive day in preparation for a settler intrusion, local sources said.
Mayor of Sebastia, Mohammad Azem, told WAFA that a large unit of Israeli soldiers raided the town and proceeded to close the site, preventing from Palestinians from accessing it, as dozens of settlers forced their way into the site.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

GAZA, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today infiltrated Gaza’s border, to the east of the city of Deir al-Balah, and razed farmlands, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the a number of Israeli military tanks and bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of the city, razed a large tract of farmland in the area and set up earth mounds.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

RAMALLAH, March 29, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli police today killed a mentally-disabled Palestinian citizen of Israel in the city of Haifa. 
The Arab 48 news website reported the sister of Munir Anabtawi, 33, saying that Munir asked his mother for money, but she hadn’t at that time. So, he went down to the street, behaving angrily. He suffers from mental disorders. 
She added that as a result, her mother called the police, asking them to make sure that Anabtawi would not pose a danger to himself and others and be transferred to a hospital. 
Police officers arrived at the scene in the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa, where they opened fire at Anabtawi, critically injuring him in the back.
Israeli media said that Anabtawi was evacuated in critical condition to the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, and declared dead soon after.
It claimed that he attempted to stab the two police officers, wounding one of them, before he was shot and injured.   
“How could the police officers shoot three bullets at the back of a mentally-disabled person instead of arresting him?” asked Anabtawi’s sister. 
Member of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Ayman Odeh, slammed the killing of Anabtawi as a continuation of Israeli police “aggressive treatment” against Palestinian citizens of Israel and the outcome of the racist policies of the Netanyahu-headed successive Israeli governments.
“Israeli police does not consider Palestinian citizens of Israel equal citizens, but enemies,” he added. 
He called for punishing all those who “recklessly and racially deal with the Palestinian blood” and stressed the need that the Anabtawis’ family doctor attend the autopsy of the slain man.

HEBRON, Monday, March 29, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today issued an order to halt reclamation work on Palestinian-owned land in the village of At-Tuwani, in the area of Masafer Yatta, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees in Masafer Yatta, Fouad al-Amour, told WAFA Israeli forces handed local resident Omar Rab'ey an order preventing him from reclaiming his land, under the pretext that the area is an archaeological site.
Palestinian residents in the village of At-Tuwani face extremely difficult conditions due to the continuous Israeli forces and settlers' violations against them, their properties, crops, and livestock, on which they depend for their livelihoods.

"Palestinian official warns of Israeli colonial settlers forming terrorist cells in the occupied West Bank""",3/29/21 11:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123862,"
SALFIT, Monday, March 29, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli colonial settlers are forming terrorist cells in the occupied West Bank ready to carry out terrorist acts against Palestinian civilians, making special reference to Price Tag terror group, today said a Palestinian official.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official in the settlement resistance commission in the northern West Bank, warned that Israeli terrorist cell members of Price Tag are currently operating in the Salfit governorate, mainly in several towns west of the governorate such as Kufr al-Dik, Deir Ballut, Broqin, and Bidya.
On Sunday afternoon, he said, a Kufr al-Dik resident was attacked by settlers who are trying to control areas north of the town, and two others were injured by settlers' bullets while they were on their land in Khallet Hassan, west of Bidya, several months ago. 
A few weeks ago, settlers attacked a family that was reclaiming its land in the village of Broqin and destroyed its vehicle, as well as attacking farmers in al-Ras and al-Marhat area, west of Salfit, as part of their efforts to establish a new settlement outpost, in addition to their provocations by storming Islamic sites on a weekly basis in Kufl Haris, northwest of Salfit.
“Settler attacks have increased since the beginning of the year and have become daily, which demands that residents of Salfit and area towns should be vigilant and attentive and form popular protection committees in all towns and villages,” said Daghlas.
“We do not want to see a massacre similar to the one of the Dawabsha family in Duma several years ago,” he added. “The recent settlers’ terrorism in Salfit indicates that they are planning criminal acts against civilians, as it is clear that their recent attacks have moved from vandalizing trees and property to attacking people.”

SALFIT, Saturday, March 27, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers attacked today evening two Palestinian farmers in the town of Kafr ad-Dik to the west of Salfit, in the occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Local activist, Faris ad-Dik, told WAFA a number of settlers, illegally residing in the occupied Palestinian Territory, attacked two farmers and vandalized their privately-owned agricultural rooms.
Israeli settlers’ vandalism in the occupied West Bank is routine and is done with full backing by the Israeli authorities, said the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.
“Settler violence and vandalism takes place with full backing by the Israeli authorities. Sometimes soldiers take part in the assault; at other times, they stand idly by. The police makes no substantial effort to investigate the incidents, nor takes measures to prevent them or stop them in real time,” it said.
Israel benefits from the repercussions, as settler violence has gradually dispossessed Palestinians of more and more areas in the West Bank, paving the way for a state takeover of land and resources, said B’Tselem.

Jaser al-Qaq, a Palestinian citizen and farmer from Kifl Hares, told WAFA that Israeli occupation soldiers and fanatic settlers forced a number of workers that he hired for the gardening and maintenance works to leave his land.
He said Israeli occupation authorities recently set up a new settlement outpost near his land, apparently in a prelude to establish a new colonial settlement in the area.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

Nofal's body was released by the Israeli occupation military and handed over to his family at Ni'lin military checkpoint, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, after being withheld since February 5 and for no reason.
Nofal, who comes from the village of Ras Karkar in the West Bank, was shot dead by armed Israeli settlers while he was on a tour near his village on the said date. His body has since been withheld by the occupation army ever since.
Israeli occupation authorities have escalated the policy of withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers, claiming that funerals of Palestinians had provided grounds for “incitement” against Israel.
Dozens of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces are still withheld in Israeli mortuaries despite calls by human rights groups on Israel to release them.

HEBRON, Friday, March 26, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today detained five Palestinians from the West Bank districts of Hebron and Jerusalem, according to security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces rounded former Minister of Local Government, Issa Jabari, 55, after storming and ransacking his house in the city of Hebron.
The soldiers also detained former member of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), Hatem Qafisha, 58, besides to another Palestinian after storming and searching their houses in the city.
Meanwhile, Israeli police rounded up two brothers in a raid in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz.
While inside the house, police officer assaulted the detainees’ brother and applied electric shocks to his body, which necessitated rushing him to hospital.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.

BETHLEHEM, Thursday, March 25, 2021 (WAFA) - A Palestinian man sustained injuries today in an attack by hardcore Israeli settlers in the village of Al-Khader, to the south of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Settlers attacked Ahmad Saeed Sbeih, 39 years old, and physically assaulted him while working in his own land, causing him bruises across his body. He was moved to nearby Beit Jala Public Hospital for medical treatment.

They said that Israeli police and staff of the Israeli municipality forced their way into Jabal al-Sal‘a area of the neighborhood, cordoned two houses before a bulldozer demolished them, purportedly for being built without licenses.
Owners of the demolished houses were identified as Khaled Abbasi, and his brother, Munir.
The Abbasi brothers built their houses in 2016 and attempted to obtain the required construction licenses to no avail. They also managed to temporarily freeze the demolition orders against their structures.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, March 24, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers today razed a plot of Palestinian land in the village of Kisan, east of the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local official.
Deputy Head of Kisan Village Council, Ahmad Ghazal, told WAFA that the Israeli military bulldozers razed three donums of land belonging to the Ibayyat family, located near the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Ibei Hanahal to expand the settlement entrance. 
He noted the plot of land was already seized by the Israeli authorities years ago, as he warned of ongoing settler violations against the village.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides to the settlement outpost of Ibei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land. 
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

The sources said that a large Israeli military unit escorted two bulldozers into the neighborhood, where the heavy machineries tore down a tin-roofed house in Ras Khamis area of the camp. 
Confrontations broke out between the Israeli soldiers and Palestinians during the demolition. No casualties were reported, however.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.

They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

They also conducted separate two raids in Anza and al-Hashemiya villages, southwest and west of Jenin, resulting in the detention of two other Palestinians.
This came as undercover Israeli forces, known as Mista'arvim, sneaked their way into the vegetable market in Jenin city, where they kidnapped a resident of Jenin refugee camp.
Meanwhile, PPS said that eight Palestinians were detained from Ramallah and al-Bireh district.
It elaborated that a sizable Israeli military force barged its way into Jalazone refugee camp, north of the city, where soldiers rounded up seven Palestinians, including four former prisoners and an attorney, and smashed the main doors of many houses.
One of the detainees was severely beaten before being handcuffed and escorted to one of the military vehicles near his house.
Soldiers also detained another Palestinian after breaking into and searching his house in al-Bireh city neighborhood of Um al-Sharayet.
During ensuing confrontations, soldiers opened fire towards scores of local youngsters who protested the raids and beaten several others.
In the southern West Bank, PPS confirmed a military raid in the city of Bethlehem, resulting in the detention of two Palestinians. 
In the meantime, soldiers re-arrested a former prisoner after breaking into his house in Hebron city.
In Tubas district, PPS said that Israeli troops carried out a raid in Tammun town, south of the city, where they re-arrested a former prisoner.
In Jerusalem, Israeli police rounded up a Palestinian after breaking into his house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

"Israeli navy targets fishermen offshore Gaza""",3/24/21 09:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123795,"
GAZA, Wednesday, March 24, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy Tuesday night targeted Palestinian fishermen offshore Gaza city, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the fishermen were sailing within three nautical miles when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire and water hoses toward them, forcing them to flee for safety. No injuries were reported though.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israeli forces block entrances to villages northwest of Ramallah""",3/23/21 16:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123790,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, March 23, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces sealed off the entrances to a number of villages to the northwest of Ramallah, in occupied West Bank, said WAFA correspondent.
Israeli forces sealed off entrances to the villages and towns of Nabi Saleh, Beit Rima, Dir Ghassaneh, Kafr Ein, Qarawat Bani Zeid, Deir Nidham, Deir Abu Mashaal, and Aboud, and prevented traffic in both directions, causing a major traffic jam.
Clashes reportedly broke out between the forces and Palestinians in Deir Abu Mashaal, during which forces fired tear gas canisters toward the Palestinians, however, no injuries or arrests were reported.
Restricting movement is one of the main tools Israel employs to enforce its regime of occupation. Israel imposes restrictions on the movement of Palestinians within the West Bank, and travel between it and the Gaza Strip, into East Jerusalem, Israel, and abroad, said B’Tselem, the Israelis information center for human rights in occupied territories.
“Palestinians’ freedom of movement in the Occupied Territories lies completely at the mercy of the state’s whims, the instructions given to soldiers at the local (DCO), and the way in which they implement them, it said.
In July 2018, OCHA completed a comprehensive ‘closure survey’ that recorded 705 permanent obstacles across the West Bank restricting or controlling Palestinian vehicular, and in some cases pedestrian, movement. This figure is three per cent higher than in December 2016, the date of the previous survey.
Road obstacles are an integral component of a broader system of access restrictions, citing security reasons, that impedes the movement of Palestinians within the West Bank and contributes to geographical fragmentation, said OCHA.

"As Palestinians held a vigil on Nablus-area mountain to prevent takeover by settlers, soldiers attack them""",3/23/21 09:32,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123783,"
NABLUS, Tuesday, March 23, 2021 (WAFA) - A number of Palestinians were early this morning injured when Israeli soldiers attacked activists who were keeping vigil on a mountain known as Jabal al-Arma, in the town of Beita, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, to prevent its takeover by Israeli settlers, a local source said.
Monawar Bani Shamseh, a Beita activist, told WAFA that the Israeli occupation forces raided the mount early in the morning and attacked the activists who were keeping an all-night vigil on the mountain to prevent the settlers from reaching it. The soldiers used rubber bullets and teargas canisters to disperse the activists in an attempt to empty it of the Palestinians to allow the settlers free access to it, causing some light injuries.
Jabal al-Arma, which spreads over 250 dunums, is one of the most archeological sites in Nablus, and the highest peak in Beita.
Atop the mountain lie walls which indicate that an ancient castle was built there, under which seven water tanks were hewn into the rock.
However, such features make the mountain a prime target for Israeli settlers as colonial settlements are often positioned above water reserves, effectively stealing water as well as land.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, March 21, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities withdrew the VIP card from Foreign Minister Riyad Malki upon his arrival in the West Bank after a meeting with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said today.
The Israeli authorities also canceled the VIP cards for two other foreign ministry officials who were traveling with Malki upon their arrival at the border crossing with Jordan on their way to the West Bank.
“The occupation authorities canceled the minister’s border pass coordination and withdrew his VIP card after he went to the ICC,” head of the foreign minister's office, Ahmad al-Deek, told WAFA.
He said the ministry will initiate contacts with the international community about the Israeli measures against Malki and his team.
“This proves once again that Israel is a rogue state, which cannot solve cases by law, but rather resorts to intimidation, sanctions and threats,” said al-Deek.
On Thursday, Malki held a meeting with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, during which they discussed work and cooperation with the court and the public prosecutor after opening a criminal investigation into the situation in Palestine.

BETHLEHEM, Sunday, March 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today evening embarked on opening a settlers-only road on Palestinian land in the village of Kissan to the east of Bethlehem, to connect two colonial settlements with one another, according to a local official.
Ahmad Ghazal, deputy head of Kisan village council, told WAFA settlers from the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Amos, built illegally on Palestinian land, opened a four-kilometer-long road designated for the sole use of settlers on Palestinian land to the east of Kissan village as a prelude to take over hundreds of dunums of land in the area.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, March 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem were forced today to demolish their houses with their own hands to avoid paying high costs and fines after they received demolition orders from the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem, according to local sources.
In al-Issawiya neighborhood in East Jerusalem, resident Sami Obaid tore down his 100-square-meter house, which was built a few months ago, with his own hands to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition on its own.

Meanwhile, Mohammad al-Sabbah was also forced to demolish his house in the area of Ras Khamis in Jerusalem.

Earlier today, Raja'e Atiyeh, a resident of al-Isawiya, embarked on tearing down his own house in the neighborhood.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.

At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal Jewish-only settlements in East Jerusalem with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.

Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

GAZA, Sunday, March 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation's navy and forces opened fire today at Palestinian fishermen sailing off Deir el-Balah and at herders to the east of Rafah in two separate incidents, said local sources. No injuries were reported.
Israeli naval boats opened fire and water cannons on fishermen while sailing at about three nautical miles from the shore of Deir el-Balah, in the center of the Strip, causing partial damage to at least one boat and forcing fishermen to return to the shore.
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation soldiers stationed at military watchtowers along the Gaza perimeter fence to the east of Rafah, south of the Strip, opened random fire toward Palestinian farmers as they were working in farmlands adjacent to the Gaza perimeter fence, forcing them to leave.
The Israeli occupation army does not allow Palestinians to be within 300 meters from the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip, which it unilaterally considers as a buffer zone, and often opens fire at any farmers, herders or civilians and whoever reaches those areas.
Israeli navy harassment of Palestinian fishermen off Gaza is also a daily occurrence, and aims at undermining the fishing industry in Gaza, a vital source of income to thousands of families there.

RAMALLAH, Saturday, March 20, 2021 (WAFA) - As many countries around the world celebrate Mother’s Day tomorrow, 12 Palestinian mothers held in Israeli jails for their resistance of the Israeli occupation are denied the right to celebrate this occasion with their children, today said the Palestinian Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs.
It said in a statement that 12 mothers out of 39 women prisoners in Israel are not only suffering the hardships of the prisons but are also suffering from their inability to be with their children on this occasion and all year around.
""The children of the imprisoned women miss their mothers on this day and on every day of the year as the Mother's Day occasion comes at a time the imprisoned mothers are forbidden visitation from their children under flimsy security pretexts, and things are becoming increasingly difficult due to restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including cessation of family visits,"" said the commission.
""The mother prisoners in Israeli jails are even living difficult psychological conditions as a result of extreme anxiety and stress, and constantly thinking of the conditions of their children and how they live without their mothers, but the more difficult for the mother prisoner is when her husband is also in prison, which means their children have to live without the care of their parents,"" it added.
The 12 mother prisoners are: Isra Jaabis, from Jerusalem, serving 11 years and a mother of one child; Khaleda Jarrar, from Ramallah, sentenced to two years, a mother of two daughters; Fadwa Hamadeh, Jerusalem, 10 years, mother of five children; Amani Hashim, Jerusalem, 10 years, mother of two children; Hilweh Hamamreh, Bethlehem, six years, mother of one baby girl; Nisreen Hassan, Gaza, six years, mother of seven children; Inas Asafreh, Hebron, 30 months, two children; Aya Khatib, from 1948 territories, in detention, mother of two; Iman Awar, Jerusalem, 22 months, six children; Khitam Saafin, Ramallah, administrative detention, mother of three; Shurouq Badan, Bethlehem, administrative detainee, mother of a child; and Anhar al-Hajjeh, Ramallah, detained on March 8, a mother of one child and is in her third month of pregnancy.

Two buildings were demolished in Ein Shibli village, in the Nablus area, displacing 17 people, on the basis of Military Order 1797, which allows for demolitions within 96 hours of the issuance of a ‘removal order.’ The remaining displacement resulted from the demolition of four homes in al Tuwani and Khallet Athaba’ communities in Hebron, and in Beit Jala in Bethlehem.
The livelihood of 20 people was affected by the demolition of a vegetable stall near Qalqilya city, while 16 were affected by the demolition of two uninhabited houses and the confiscation of one metal container in Isteih in the Jericho area. Two of the nine structures targeted in East Jerusalem were demolished by the owner.
Meanwhile, Israeli settlers injured six Palestinians in the Hebron governorate and damaged Palestinian-owned property, including vehicles and trees. Four of the injured were physically assaulted in three incidents. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, were injured in two separate incidents in the H2 area of Hebron city and the Bir al ‘Idd area, respectively; in the latter incident, the donkey on which the boy was riding was stabbed.
A man and a woman were attacked with clubs near the Mantikat Shi’b al Butum, where the man sustained severe head injuries. The remaining two injured were herders stoned and attacked with knives near Bani Na’im near Hebron and three of their sheep were injured. On a number of other occasions in Hebron (Saadet Tha'lah) and Bethlehem (Kisan), Israeli settlers chased herders out of the area.
At least 42 trees and saplings were uprooted in Kafr Qaddum village near Qalqilya and al-Tuwani; agricultural tools were also stolen in the Kafr Qaddum incident. Palestinians reported that settlers had grazed their livestock on land belonging to Palestinians from Yanun village near Nablus, damaging olive trees, and attacked farmers working their land in Ein Samiya near Ramallah, damaging a tractor.
According to Palestinian sources, Israeli settlers damaged at least five vehicles, a house and an agricultural structure in the villages of Jalud and Huwwara in the Nablus district, and Kafr ad Dik and Bruqin in the Salfit district.
On 10 March, five Palestinian boys, aged about 10, were held by settlers while picking wild herbs near the illegal settlement outpost of Havat Maon in Hebron governorate. They were later detained and brought to Kiryat Arba settlement police station by soldiers before being released later that day.
Israeli forces carried out 193 search-and-arrest operations during the reporting period and arrested 172 Palestinians, including 15 children, across the West Bank. The Ramallah governorate recorded the highest number of operations (48), followed by the Hebron (37) and Jerusalem governorates (35).

HEBRON, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian young man sustained bruises and wounds today when he was physically attacked by Israeli fanatic settlers in the village of Susia, east of the town of Yatta in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Rateb Jabour, a local official in charge of monitoring settler attacks, told WAFA that a group of settlers from the illegal settlement of Susya, named after the same village, physically attacked the young man and beat him up, causing them bruises and wounds across his body and fractures in the foot. He was moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
The village is part of Masafer Yatta, a collection of about 19 nomadic Bedouin hamlets that have been a frequent target of almost daily assaults by the Israeli military and settlers, who wish to empty the area of its indigenous Palestinian population in favor of the colonial settlement enterprise.
Almost everyday, attacks by the Israeli occupation forces or settlers on Palestinians are reported in the area.

NABLUS, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Several Palestinians sustained injuries today by Israeli occupation forces, as the former were fending off a provocative visit by colonial Israeli settlers to an archeological site in the village of al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, south of Nablus city in the occupied West Bank, according to WAFA correspondent. 
He said that scores of Israeli settlers accompanied by soldiers forced their way into Khan al-Laban, an Ottoman-era site near the village, and blocked access of local Palestinian citizens to the site.
The Israeli soldiers fired teargas towards the villagers who attempted to fend off the provocative visit and physically assaulted and pushed some of them, causing several injuries among them.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement of Ma'ale Levona, established in 1983 on Palestinian-owned land.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

"Jerusalem Governorate urges immediate action against forcible eviction of Sheikh Jarrah""",3/19/21 16:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123732,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian Authority's Jerusalem Governorate called today upon the international community to assume its responsibility and prevent Israel from forcibly evicting and demolishing houses of Palestinian families in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem.
Since November 2008, Israeli occupation authorities have forcibly expelled five Palestinian families in Karem Al-Ja'oni section of Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood from their homes. Today, an additional eight Palestinian families are under the imminent threat of being evicted from their homes. These houses are all included in the 28 Palestinian houses designated for eviction to make way for a new Israeli settlement known as ""Shimon HaTsadiq"". A plan for the settlement, consisting of 200 housing units on 18 dunums, has already been submitted to the Israeli municipality in Jerusalem.
In Batn Al Hawa neighborhood in Silwan, seven Palestinian families are under the imminent threat of being forcibly evicted from their homes. They are part of 87 families designated for forcible house eviction in the neighborhood. An Israeli court had previously rejected the petition filed by the residents of Batn al-Hawa neighborhood in Al-Hara Al-Wusta (central quarter) of Silwan, south of occupied East Jerusalem, and allowed ""Ateret Cohanim"" settler organizations to continue its procedures relevant to the immediate expelling of seven aforementioned Palestinian families
The Israeli municipality in Jerusalem has also asked Israeli courts to reactivate demolition orders relating to 119 of buildings housing 1,550 Palestinians in al-Bustan neighborhood in Silwan in occupied East Jerusalem. The request was filed with an Israeli court three weeks ago. If approved, seven of the 119 houses in the al-Bustan neighborhood are at immediate risk of demolition.
These families are victims of the cruel and systematic Israeli occupation policies aimed at ethnically cleansing the city of its Palestinian inhabitants.
Hundreds of Palestinian families are being threatened with evictions and house demolitions from their homes by illegal settler groups, fully supported by the Israeli government. In the neighborhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan alone, homes that have been evicted of their Palestinian inhabitants, being replaced by illegal settler groups implanted in the middle of the Palestinian neighborhoods. 
""The Israeli policy of forcible displacement, home evictions and house demolition is a tool being used to push Palestinians outside their capital,"" said the Jerusalem Governorate in a statement. ""Such policies against an occupied population are nothing short of War Crimes under international law, and so the international community must recognize and acknowledge this tragedy.""
The Jerusalem Governorate called upon the international community to urgently intervene and actively end Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and their policies of forcible evictions and house demolitions in Occupied East Jerusalem.

"Israeli troops quell solidarity rally south of Hebron""",3/19/21 14:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123731,"
HEBRON, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli troops today quelled a solidarity rally in Ayn al-Bayda, southeast of Yatta city in the southern West Bank district of Hebron, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that dozens of Palestinians performed the weekly Friday prayer at the site of Ayn al-Bayda, also written as Ein al-Baida, nestled between the encroaching nearby Israeli colonial settlements of Ma‘on and Karmiel, in solidarity with the landowners whose land at the site is at the risk of confiscation for settlement expansion. 
The rally participants, who included a number of international activists, shouted slogans condemning the Israeli systematic policy of ethnically cleansing against Palestinians and calling for an end to the foreign Israeli occupation. 
Israeli soldiers raided the site and assaulted the participants with rifle butts as a means to disperse them.
Ratib Jbour, an activist who took part in the rally, pointed that the site has become a scene of weekly rallies since the Israeli occupation authorities and settlers continue to raze it to make room for setting up livestock farms for settlers. 
Almost three weeks ago, Israeli settler bulldozers leveled large tract of farmland belonging to the Bhais, Shawahin, Zhuhur and Id‘eis families at the site of Ayn al-Bayda to enable settlers to set up the livestock farms.

"Palestinian killed from Israeli military gunfire near Nablus""",3/19/21 13:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123729,"
NABLUS, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today shot and killed a Palestinian taking part in an anti-settlement rally near Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus, according to Health Ministry.
The Ministry confirmed that Israeli forces opened fire towards the participants of a rally called for to defend Palestinian-owned land threatened with confiscation, east of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction, seriously injuring a protestor with a live round in the head.

"Palestinians torch tent set up by settlers near Bethlehem""",3/19/21 13:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123728,"
BETHLEHEM, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinians Thursday torched a tent previously set up by Israeli settlers on Palestinian-owned land near Kisan village, east of Bethlehem, according to an official.
Deputy Head Village Council of Kisan, Ahmad Ghazal, said that a group of the villagers torched a tent previously erected by settlers on a plot of land belonging to ‘Allan Tabahin to serve as the nucleus of a new colonial settlement outpost in the Sadda area, southeast of the village, and alongside the Ma‘ale Amos colonial settlement.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides to the settlement outpost ofIbei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

"Settlers vandalize vehicles, scrawl hate graffiti near Jerusalem""",3/19/21 10:57,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123726,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers dawn Friday vandalized Palestinian vehicles and scrawled hate graffiti in Beit Iksa village, northwest of Jerusalem, according to local sources.
They said that a group of settlers sneaked their way into the southern section of the village, where they set fire to two vehicles belonging to Hamdan Karshan and spray-painted racist graffiti.
Palestinian Civil Defense crews rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire which consumed completely the vehicles.
Sources added that Israeli forces raided the village following the settler attack, and interrogated a number of the villagers.
“Price tag” refers to an underground anti-Palestinian Israeli group that routinely attacks Palestinians in the occupied territories and inside Israel.
The Israeli government still refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and considers it only as group of vandals.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

"Israeli forces target Gaza farmers, shepherds""",3/19/21 10:41,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123725,"
GAZA, Friday, March 19, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday morning targeted farmers and shepherds to the east of al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli forces stationed along the border to the east of the camp opened gunfire towards a group of farmers and shepherds as the latter were tending to their land and livestock, forcing them to flee for safety.
Meanwhile, Israeli navy opened fire and water hoses towards Palestinian fishermen sailing three nautical miles offshore As-Sudaniya and al-Waha areas, northeast of Gaza. 
No injuries were reported though.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"After plans to demolish 100 homes in East Jerusalem, more Palestinian homes under threat of demolition by Israel""",3/18/21 11:26,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123716,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, March 18, 2021 (WAFA) – As plans loom for the demolition of an entire area that includes 100 houses in occupied East Jerusalem, at least eight more Palestinian-owned homes in the occupied city are facing an imminent threat of demolition by the Israeli municipality under the pretext of construction without a permit, today said different sources.
In Silwan neighborhood, two homeowners from the Abbasi family were informed by their lawyer that efforts to get a building permit for the building they constructed in 2016 to shelter their families have failed after the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem has refused to give them the necessary permit and therefore they have to empty their homes of the furniture and people in order to have them demolished, according to Khaled Abu Tayeh, member of the Committee for the Defense of Silwan Lands.
Seven people live in the two homes, including three children, he said, adding that the Israeli municipality also informed four other households in Silwan that they should empty their homes in preparation for their demolition under the pretext of construction without a permit.
The Israeli municipality also plans to demolish 100 homes in al-Bustan section of Silwan, which means displacing their 1550 Palestinian residents, more than 60 percent of them are children under the age of 18.
In Isawiyya, another East Jerusalem neighborhood, local sources said the Israeli municipality posted demolition orders on two Palestinian-owned houses in the neighborhood under the pretext of construction without a permit.
An editorial in the Israeli daily Haaretz today called on the Israeli mayor of West Jerusalem, Moshe Leon, to ""stop the bulldozers"" in occupied East Jerusalem.

"Israel receives a letter from the International Criminal Court on its war crimes charges""",3/18/21 09:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123712,"
TEL AVIV, Thursday, March 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel received at the end of last week a letter from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague regarding charges of committing war crimes in the Palestinian territories, Israeli media said last night.
The Israeli Channel 13 TV station said Israel was given 30 days to respond to the letter, which said the charges will focus on Israel’s 2014 war on Gaza, the Israeli settlement activities, in addition to the deadly assault on the March of Return on the Gaza border in 2018.
Earlier this month, the Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, said that the Court will initiate an investigation into charges of Israeli crimes in the Palestinian territories.
A number of Israeli officials have told Channel 13 that they are concerned that the ICC may actually begin issuing in the coming months arrest warrants against former Israeli military officials and commanders.
Palestine joined the International Criminal Court in 2015.

"UN: 77 humanitarian aid structures, including 47 EU-funded, targeted by Israel in February""",3/17/21 17:21,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123710,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) - So far in 2021, the Israeli targeting of EU-funded aid structures to the Palestinians tripled compared with the monthly average in 2020 and Israeli settlers damaged and stole donor-funded aid, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt).
In February, said the report titled West Bank demolitions and displacement | February 2021, the Israeli authorities demolished, forced people to demolish, or seized 153 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem: this is the fourth highest such figure recorded in a single month since OCHA began systematically documenting this practice in 2009, surpassed only by November 2020 (178), February (237) and March 2016 (179).
This month’s incidents resulted in the displacement of 305 people, including 172 children, and affected the livelihoods or access to services of 435 others. With the exception of two structures in Tura al Gharbiya in the Jenin district, demolished or damaged on punitive grounds, all the structures targeted were located in Area C of the occupied West Bank or in occupied East Jerusalem and were demolished due to a lack of building permits, which are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain.
So far in 2021, the monthly average of structures targeted (117) represents a 65 per cent increase compared with the monthly average in 2020 (71).
On five separate occasions in February, the herding community of Humsa – Al Bqai’a in the northern Jordan Valley witnessed the confiscation and demolition of 82 structures by the Israeli authorities. Nearly 80 percent of the targeted structures (65) were provided as humanitarian aid and included homes, WASH and livelihood structures, at a value of at least 43,000 euros. As a result of these five incidents, some 60 people, including 35 children were displaced.
In a statement issued on 24 February following a visit to Humsa – Al Bqai’a, the Humanitarian Coordinator for the oPt, Lynn Hastings, called on the Israeli authorities to ""immediately halt all further demolitions of Palestinian homes and possessions, allow the humanitarian community to provide shelter, food and water to this most vulnerable group and these people to remain in their homes."" So far in 2021, over 50 percent of all targeted structures have been located in Bedouin and herding communities in Area C, up from 31 percent in 2020. These communities are some of the most vulnerable in the West Bank, with limited access to education and health services, and to water, sanitation, and electricity infrastructure.
Nearly 90 percent of all structures targeted (demolished or seized) in February were seized without prior warning in Area C. This is a significant increase compared with 30 percent in 2020, 11 percent in 2017 and eight percent in 2016. Seizure procedures do not oblige the authorities to provide prior notice, thus preventing affected people from objecting in advance and have been characterized by the Head of the Supervision Unit within the ICA as ""a strategic tool"".
So far in 2021, a total of 93 structures provided as humanitarian aid have been demolished or seized by the Israeli authorities, compared with 157 structures in all of 2020.
Additionally, in Bruqin in the Salfit district, Israeli settlers destroyed, uprooted, or stole donor-funded saplings and infrastructure materials for a value of 2,300 euros. A family of seven was affected by the incident.
Fifteen structures were demolished in East Jerusalem: seven were demolished by the West Jerusalem Israeli municipality and seven by the owners themselves, following the issuance of a demolition order.
The largest incident took place in al-Isawiyya on 22 February, where the Jerusalem Municipality accompanied by Israeli forces demolished a residential building comprising four apartments, displacing 19 people, including 10 children. The affected families had been paying fines since 2017 for building without a permit and received a final demolition order in July 2020 and a verbal warning the day before the demolition. Clashes erupted during the demolition incident, during which a Palestinian man was injured with a rubber bullet.
On 10 February, the Israeli authorities punitively demolished a home in the village of Tura al Gharbiya in Jenin, in Area B, belonging to a Palestinian man indicted for killing an Israeli settler on 20 December 2020. A family of seven, including four children, was displaced, in addition to a family of four displaced due to collateral damage caused by the demolition.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today intensified their military presence in Al-Matar Street in the town of Kafr 'Aqab, north of the occupied city of Jerusalem, according to a media source.
The Kafr 'Aqab Municipality’s media officer, Raed Hamdan, told WAFA that the forces have intensified their military presence in the area since yesterday, and posted a sign announcing the establishment of a settler-only sports complex and a park at the expense of Palestinians’ land.
Last night, a number of Palestinian civilians were injured with rubber-coated metal bullets and many others suffered from suffocation due to inhaling tear gas during clashes with the Israeli forces in the town of Kafr Aqab.
Earlier, Israeli forces demolished a warehouse, razed Palestinian-owned land and threatened to demolish commercial stores in the neighborhood, which they declared as a military zone.

"Israeli forces razes land, uproot olive trees near Ramallah""",3/17/21 12:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123705,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today razed a Palestinain plot of land and uprooted olive trees in the village of Ras Karkar, northwest of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, according to sources.
The landowner, Nu‘man Nofal, said that Israeli soldiers escorted a bulldozer to the village, where the heavy machinery leveled his five donums of land and uprooted more than 20 olive trees.
He added that the Israeli occupation authorities have already seized 38 donums of his land during the past two years, and currently prevent him from accessing the remaining 12 donums of land to cultivate it.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli forces detain 13 Palestinians from West Bank""",3/17/21 11:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123704,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday overnight detained 13 Palestinians from various parts of the West Bank, according to the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS).
PPS confirmed in a press release that Israeli forces rounded up five Palestinians, including a 16-year-old teen, in multiple raids across Bethlehem district.
One of the detainees was identified as a resident of the Bethlehem neighborhood of As-Saf, another as a resident of the Bethlehem neighborhood of al-Karkafeh, and the three others as residents of Tuqu‘ town, south of the city.
In the northern West Bank, PPS confirmed a military raid in the western neighborhood of Tulkarm city, resulting in the detention of a Palestinian.
Israeli soldiers conducted another raid in Deir al-Ghusun town, northeast of Tulkarm city, where they rounded up another.
Meanwhile, an Israeli military force barged its way into Qalqiliya city, where it detained two others after breaking into and ransacking their families’ houses.
PPS confirmed that four others were rounded up in raids across the West Bank districts of Nablus, Jericho and Jerusalem.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

"Israeli settlers level area opposite to Hebron’s Ibrahimi Mosque""",3/17/21 11:21,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123703,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today leveled an area opposite to the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Old City of Hebron, according to the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee (HRC).
HRC said that Israeli settlers razed the interior of an old house belonging to the Idris family, located opposite to the resting area of the Ibrahimi Mosque and within an area deemed a closed military zone, where HRC staff are denied access to carry out restoration works. 
The house was handed over by the Israeli occupation authorities to settlers.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada Street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.

HEBRON, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning dismantled and seized an agricultural room, east of Yatta town, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to an activist.
Fuad al-'Amour, the Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committee in Masafer Yatta, told WAFA that Israeli forces barged their way into al-Fakhit, east of Yatta, where they dismantled an agricultural room made of tin and seized it.
Al-Fakhit is one of the 19 hamlets making up the Masafer Yatta, which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

NABLUS, Wednesday, March 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Wednesday morning uprooted and stole scores of olive saplings from Jalud village, south of the West Bank city of Nablus, according to an activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers sneaked their way into al-Sheikh Bishr area in the village, where they uprooted and stole 40 olive saplings belonging to Rajeh Hamoud.
In February, settlers broke into a sheep barn belonging to a shepherd from the Hamoud family, causing damage to the barn and stealing sheep.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement outpost of Ahiya, constructed on confiscated Palestinian land.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

"Israeli bulldozers level farmlands northwest of Bethlehem""",3/16/21 16:45,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123695,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, March 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today leveled Palestinian farmland to the northwest of Beit Jala city, west of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to an activist.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem, Hassan Breijah, said that an Israeli military force escorted a bulldozer into Wadi al-Makhrour, where the heavy machinery razed a plot of farmland, covering an area of four donums, belonging to Ramzi Qaisieh.
Wadi al-Makhrour is a popular hiking spot for Palestinians. It is best enjoyed during the late afternoon in the summer when the sun is about to set.
According to the online portal for Palestinian tourism, www.visitpalestine.ps, the area encompasses both natural and agricultural landscapes and is well known for its ancient terraces and stone towers called qusur, built of neatly placed rocks that used to serve as storage rooms for various crops planted in the wadi.
The area is famous for its hills replete with agricultural terraces full of olive, apricot, and fig trees. The abundance of the place is owed to the underground natural springs and also to the hard work of the landowners. Some parts of the valley are home to natural forests with remarkable tree species such as Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos). 
Israeli forces have been targeting Wadi al-Makhrour seeking to forcefully displace the indigenous Palestinian residents from their land for Jewish-only settlement expansion.
The largely Christian city of Beit Jala is flanked by Gilo and Har Gilo settlements to the north and northwest.

HEBRON, Tuesday, March 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today worked on Palestinian-owned land in Masafer Yatta in the south of the West Bank in an attempt to take over the land, according to Fouad al-Imour, a local activist.
He told WAFA that settlers from the illegal settlements of Maon and Karmiel, and under army protection, razed agricultural lands in al-Oyoun al-Beed of Masafer Yatta and owned by three local families in order to take them over to expand their settlements and connect them together.
He said the settlers last week razed a nearby land but were confronted by the residents and activists and were forced to leave it, explaining that the settlers have intensified their attacks on Palestinian-owned lands in the vulnerable Masafer Yatta region, which is classified as Area C that falls under full Israeli military control.
Palestinians are not allowed to build in or develop Area C, which makes more than 60 percent of the area of the occupied West Bank, while Israelis are allowed free hand to steal and build in that area at will.

HEBRON, Tuesday, March 16, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian landowner said today that Israeli settlers made 15 attempts to take over his farm in al-Baqa'a, east of the southern West Bank city of Hebron in recent times, the last of which was today when they attempted to destroy crops planted in his 25-dunum plot of land.
Aref Jaber, the landowner, told WAFA that Israeli settlers from the illegal settlement of Harsina attempted to run him over and kick him out of his land and raze it by force but that human rights activists who were present intervened and forced the settlers to leave the area.
Lands in the village of al-Baqa'a are considered Hebron's food basket but are currently under repeated threats from the Israeli occupation forces and settlers, who try to destroy their agricultural lands and demolish water pools on which farmers depend to irrigate their crops, aiming to displace the Palestinians who live there by forcing them to abandon their lands and village.

Khalil Taqtaq, one of the farmers, said they were forced to wait for three hours behind the separation barrier for Israeli soldiers manning the gate in the barrier to arrive and open the gate.
He said the occupation forces prevented them yesterday from reaching their land behind the barrier, despite being notified by the Israeli side that they would be allowed access to their lands. He said they were surprised when they arrived in the morning to find out that the gate was closed, where they stayed for three and a half hours waiting in vain before returning to their homes.
To be noted, Palestinians whose land lies behind the separation barrier must obtain special permits – which are not easily granted and are often given to only specific family members - to reach their land.

"Israeli decisions to evacuate, demolish dozens of homes in East Jerusalem amounting to war crimes – rights group""",3/15/21 17:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123676,"
GENEVA, Monday, March 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Three dangerous Israeli decisions threatening to evacuate and demolish dozens of homes in East Jerusalem paving the way for implementing Israeli plans for a massive destruction and displacement operation against the population may amount to the crime of ethnic cleansing and a war crime, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor said in a statement.
The Israeli decisions coincide with the authorities' establishment of settlement projects in the heart of Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem to perpetuate a policy of racial discrimination against the Palestinian population, it added.
The Euro-Med Monitor referred to the decision of the Israeli District Court issued on March 4 to reject an appeal submitted by three Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem against the decision of the Israeli Magistrate's Court issued on September 4, 2020. Thus, the evacuation decision will enter into force no later than August 2021 against the Hammad, Dawoudi and Dajani families, consisting of seven families and 25 individuals, including eight children.
This decision comes after the Israeli District Court rejected on February 10 the appeal of four families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood against the Magistrate's Court's decision issued against them in October 2020. The families, al-Jauni, al-Qasim, Iskafi and al-Kurd, include seven households of 30 individuals, including 10 children.
In November 2020, the Israeli Magistrate's Court decided to activate the Sabbagh family's evacuation, consisting of five households and 32 people, including 10 children. Thus, 19 households from eight families, comprising 78 people, of whom 28 are children, remain threatened with forced displacement at any moment.
The Euro-Med Monitor indicated that while the Israeli occupation authorities insist on eviction decisions against Palestinian homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, the municipality has approved establishing a memorial for soldiers of a battalion in the Israeli army paratrooper's brigade killed during the occupation of Jerusalem in 1967.
According to Israeli media, the plan includes building observation points and a small theatre while the neighborhood's Palestinian residents suffer from a lack of public institutions and open spaces.
The project is funded by the Permanent Fund of Israel, at the cost of one million Israeli Shekels (about $300,540), and it is located in the heart of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. This means that dozens of Palestinian families in the area will face lawsuits demanding evacuating their homes, as part of an extensive settlement scheme in the neighborhood, given that settlement associations claim the existence of Jewish ownership of the neighborhood since before 1948.
The Euro-Med Monitor also expressed grave concern over the demolition plans that the West Jerusalem Israeli municipality is preparing for in Silwan neighborhood adjacent to Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, which places dozens of Palestinian homes under threat of demolition at any moment.
On March 11 the Israeli municipality in Jerusalem unveiled a decision that rejected engineering plans for the al-Bustan neighborhood in Silwan. The court also decided not to extend the freeze on the demolition of the neighborhood's homes.
According to Fakhri Abu Diab, a spokesman for the Committee for the Defense of Silwan Lands and Homes, the Israeli municipality has rejected the engineering plans it had previously requested to present over the past years to stop the demolition of the neighborhood.
Abu Diab stressed that the municipality disavowed and cancelled previous agreements with engineers, lawyers, and the neighborhood committee not to demolish the neighborhood, despite the people's commitment to provide and develop plans, open streets, and allocate some sites for public infrastructure facilities such as schools and playgrounds.
Under this development, 100 homes, inhabited by 1,550 people, most of them children and women, in the al-Bustan neighborhood are at risk of displacement.
The Euro-Med Monitor said that these Israeli decisions and plans related to the evacuation, demolition and displacement of Palestinians, and the establishment of Jewish buildings and landmarks, reflect the apartheid system that Israel pursues in light of its reliance on discriminatory laws and unfair policies.
These plans come in light of the acceleration of demolition of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem as data show that the Israeli occupation forces destroyed 148 homes, displacing 450 people in East Jerusalem neighborhoods during 2020.
The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor affirmed that the Israeli authorities' demolitions and eviction decisions consecrate a systematic policy as part of their efforts to displace Palestinians forcibly, as part of the attempts to change the demography of the occupied city.
Euro-Med Monitor stressed that the destruction and unlawful deportation of civilians in the occupied territories violate the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitute a war crime under paragraph 4 of Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court issued in Rome on July 17, 1998, which stipulated the definition of the crime of aggression. In it: ""Extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.""
Euro-Med Monitor warned that the destruction operations are characterized by racial discrimination committed by the Israeli army. While it creates restrictions and obstacles that prevent Palestinians from obtaining building permits, it uses the lack of permission as a pretext to carry out the escalating demolitions. It is one of many pretexts for demolition, including security, punitive and other excuses, which ultimately lead to the policy of destroying homes to displace Palestinians in exchange for allowing the establishment of hundreds of settlement units and providing support and budgets for that.
Euro-Med Monitor called on the international community and the United Nations to shoulder their responsibilities in stopping Israeli violations and urgently intervening to stop house demolition plans and change the city's demographic reality.

NABLUS, Monday, March 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Clashes broke out today between Israeli occupation forces and Palestinians in the village of Beit Dajan, east of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, while Israeli settlers tore down fences in the village of Qaryout, south of Nablus, according to local sources.
Sources said Israeli soldiers stormed the village of Beit Dajan and held a number of youths at the eastern part of the village provoking confrontations with the residents who rushed to help the youths.
The soldiers fired live ammunition and teargas canisters at the residents. However, no injuries were reported.
Meanwhile, a group of Israeli settlers destroyed fences surrounding several plots of farmland in the village of Qaryout, to the south of Nablus, in an effort to prevent Palestinians from protecting their lands.
Sources said the settlers from the illegal settlement of Shavot Rahel, raided the Palestinian land and sabotaged the fences the Palestinian landowners had set up on their lands near the settlement to protect them from being taken over by the settlers who regularly steal Palestinian lands to expand their illegal settlements.

BETHLEHEM, Monday, March 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today demolished three agricultural rooms in Beit Ta‘mir village, southeast of Bethlehem, according to an activist.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committee in Bethlehem district, Hassan Breija, said that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer into the village, where the heavy machinery  tore down three agricultural rooms belonging to the Mhaimeed family purportedly for being built without licenses.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

HEBRON, Monday, March 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today seized a herd of sheep in Janba locality, to east of Yatta town, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local sources said.
Fouad al-Amour, a local activist, told WAFA that the Israeli forces confiscated about 100 sheep belonging to Nabil al-Jabareen under the pretext that they entered a prohibited area.
Al-Jabareen told WAFA correspondent that the soldiers initially attempted seizing four herds consisting of 400 sheep, but shepherds were successful of retrieving most of them.
Janba is a part of Masafer Yatta, a collection of almost 19 hamlets to the south of Hebron, which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

"Palestinians forced to demolish their structures in Jerusalem""",3/15/21 09:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123665,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, March 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities Sunday late night forced two Palestinians to demolish their structures in the East Jerusalem neighborhoods of Jabal al-Mukabbir and Silwan, according to local sources.
The Wadi Hilweh Information Center said that Ahmad Hijazi was forced to tear down his own house in Ein al-Lawzeh area of the Silwan neighborhood to avoid paying 100,000-150,000 shekels (approx. USD$30,000-45,000) in exorbitant demolition costs to the Israeli municipality if it carries out the demolition.  
“I carried out restoration works to the parking lot of my house, turning it to a house. Three years later, the municipality imposed 25,000 shekels in construction fine on me. During this period, I tried to obtain a license, but the municipality eventually issued a demolition order. I tried to appeal the order at the court, but to no avail,” Hijazi said.  
Meanwhile, Mohammad Abu Hussein emptied the contents of his restaurant, which has existed for 20 years, in Jabal al-Mukabbir before he embarked on demolishing it to avoid paying similar extortionate costs to the municipality crews if they carry out the demolition.
He said that the Israeli municipality issued the demolition order and imposed a fine on him three years ago, noting that he managed to temporarily freeze the order for several years, but the demolition was eventually demolished.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Netanyahu carries out provocative visit to Masafer Yatta in Hebron """,3/14/21 21:23,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123663,"
HEBRON, Sunday, March 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu carried out a provocative visit today evening to the ancient village of Susiya in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank.
Netanyahu, accompanied by a large number of settlers, stormed the ancient village of Susiya amid tight military measures, according to WAFA reporter.
The Israeli army closed the area, declared it a closed military zone, and closed surrounding military checkpoints to prevent international and local solidarity activists and press crews from reaching the area.
Prior to the visit, the occupation forces attacked a mass march held in Masafer Yatta area in protest of Netanyahu’s anticipated visit.
Forces reportedly attacked hundreds of protesters, representatives of national activities and civil institutions, foreign solidarity activists and peace advocates, with sound bombs and tear gas canisters. No injuries were reported.    
Protesters carried the Palestinian flag and chanted slogans condemning the Israeli occupation and the policy of ethnic cleansing which it carries out against Masafer Yatta residents in favor of settlement projects. 
Masafer Yatta, a collection of almost 19 hamlets that rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood. It is located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control.
The area has been a frequent target of almost daily assaults by the Israeli military and settlers, who wish to empty the area of its indigenous Palestinian population for settlement expansion purposes.

"Israel to take over large swathes of Palestinian land near Bethlehem""",3/14/21 13:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123660,"
BETHLEHEM, Sunday, March 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities approved today a plan aiming to seize dozens of dunams of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank province of Bethlehem, according to Hasan Brejiyeh, director of the Wall and Colonization Resistance office in Bethlehem.
He told WAFA that the Israeli occupation authorities ordered the confiscation of large tracts of Palestinian-owned land outside the illegal settlement of Bitar Illit in favor of colonial settlement construction and expansion.
He said the land to be confiscated will be used for opening settler-only roads and building new housing units for the colonial Israeli settler population.  
There are over 700,000 colonial Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
According to Israeli rights group B'Tselem, Israel has used a complex legal and bureaucratic mechanism to take control of more Palestinian land in the West Bank. 
The principal tool used to take control of land is to declare it ""state land."" This process began in 1979 and is based on a manipulative implementation of the Ottoman Land Law of 1858. Other methods employed by Israel to take control of land include seizure for military needs, declaration of land as ""abandoned assets,"" and the expropriation of land for public needs.

"Man shot to death in Arab city of Tira""",3/14/21 11:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123658,"
NAZARETH, Sunday, March 14, 2021 (WAFA) – In a latest episode of the homicide wave encouraged by Israeli police tolerance of criminality in Arab-majority communities in 1948-occupied Palestine, a young Palestinian man was shot and killed in the central Arab city of Tira last night.
27-year-old Mohammad Iyad Qasem was taken to hospital of critical gunfire wounds, where medical personnel confirmed his death.
The deadly incident comes only a week after Palestinian child Mohammad Abdul-Razeq Adas was shot dead in the neighboring Arab town of Jaljulia.
With this latest incident, at least 17 Arabs have been killed in separate shooting incidents in what seems to be an organized wave of terror fueled by Israeli police's inaction and failure to bring perpetrators to account.
For two months now, Palestinians across the Arab land occupied since 1948 have been demonstrating every week outside Israeli police stations in Arab-majority cities in condemnation of police failure to investigate crime incidents and even suspected collaboration with criminal gangs.
Last Friday, thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the Israeli police station in Umm al-Fahm and shouted slogans that denounced the Israeli police as a main accomplice in the ongoing crime wave.

"Jerusalem family ordered to empty their home for demolition """,3/14/21 08:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123653,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, March 14, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian family from the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan embarked last night on emptying their home after the Israeli municipality informed them that the home will be demolished soon for lack on an Israeli-issued construction permit.
Khaled Abu Tayeh, member of the Silwan Land Defense Committee, told WAFA that the Israeli municipality notified the family of Ahmad Hejazi to empty their home ahead of an imminent demolition by the municipality.
He said the family built their home in 2014 without getting a permit due to the unreasonable prerequisites imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities on planning and construction for the native Palestinian citizens of the city, unlike the colonial Israeli settler population who enjoy unlimited facilities on construction and tax exemptions.
Palestinians in Jerusalem say they are forced to build without a permit because getting a building permit is impossible as the right-wing mayor and city council attempt to keep the city’s Palestinian population at a bare minimum while multiplying its Jewish residents by approving the construction of thousands of new housing units in Jewish settlements.

JERUSALEM, Friday, March 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Armed Israeli occupation soldiers have been filmed arresting Palestinian children and forcefully dragging them away for picking vegetables near the illegal Israeli settlement outpost of Havat Maon, south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank.
A video, captured by Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, shows a number of young boys being led away by soldiers and bundled into a white van.
At one point, a boy is seen trying to intervene and rescue one of the children but is quickly dragged away by other soldiers.
“This is another example of the absolute disregard on the part of Israeli authorities and forces on the ground to the well-being and rights of Palestinians, no matter how young or vulnerable,” B’Tselem spokesman Amit Gilutz said.
“The youngest boy from yesterday's incident is eight years old,” he added.
The children, whose ages range from eight to 13, were held for around five hours, according to Gaby Lasky, a human rights lawyer who is representing them. The two oldest, who are 12 and 13, and therefore old enough to face charges, were ordered to return next week for more questioning.
Earlier yesterday, a group of Israeli settlers opened gunfire towards two Palestinian children in nearby Masafer Yatta area. The two children, 12 and 13 years old, were not wounded in the attack.
All Israeli settlements as illegal and a major obstacle to bringing about an independent Palestinian state including the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 war. The international community also views the settlements as illegal and an impediment to peace.

JERUSALEM, Friday, March 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces obstructed today the entry of hundreds of Palestinian worshipers into Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, in the Old City of occupied Jerusalem and detained five of them, according to witnesses.
Police also reportedly clashed with worshipers following Friday prayer at the Lions Gate area, on the east side of the holy site, and forced many of them out of the compound as they fired stun grenades to disperse them.
Incidents of beating and physical assault of worshipers by the Israeli police were also reported.
At least 321 worshipers who entered Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank for the weekly Friday prayer were also denied access to the holy site by the police, and were asked to return to the West Bank.
The Jordan-run Islamic Endowments Department, the custodian of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, estimated that around 20,000 worshipers were able to perform Friday prayer at the holy site in spite of Israeli restrictions.
Israel captured and annexed East Jerusalem, where the compound is located, during the 1967 war in a move never recognized by the global community.

"Israeli troops quell solidarity rally south of Hebron""",3/12/21 15:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123635,"
HEBRON, March 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli troops today quelled a solidarity rally in Ayn al-Bayda, southeast of Yatta city in the southern West Bank district of Hebron, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that dozens of Palestinians performed the weekly Friday prayer at the site of Ayn al-Bayda, also written as Ein al-Baida, nestled between the encroaching nearby Israeli colonial settlements of Ma‘on and Karmiel, in solidarity with the landowners whose land at the site is at the risk of confiscation for settlement expansion. 
Among the rally participants, who shouted slogans condemning settlement construction and calling for an end to the foreign Israeli occupation, were a number of international solidarity and peace activists. 
Israeli soldiers raided the site and assaulted the participants as a means to disperse them.
Ratib Jbour, an activist who took part in the rally, urged international human rights organizations to immediately intervene to stop the policy of ethnic cleansing exercised by Israel against the Palestinian people to make room for colonial settlement expansion.
Almost two weeks ago, Israeli settler bulldozers leveled large tract of farmland belonging to the Bhais, Shawahin, Zhuhur and Id‘eis families at the site of Ayn al-Bayda to enable settlers to set up livestock farms.

NABLUS, Friday, March 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-settlement-construction rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, injuring a number of participants, according to an activist.
Member of the Land Defense Committee, Salim Abu Jaish, told WAFA that a large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend Palestinian-owned land threatened with confiscation, east of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction.
Soldiers opened fire towards the participants, injuring three of them with live ammunition, two others with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing dozens others to suffocate from tear gas.
They also assaulted two protestors, beating them with rifle butts.   
Beit Dajan has become a scene for weekly protests against the Israeli authorities move to construct new colonial settlements and expand existing ones at the expense of Palestinian territory.
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

"Israel orders halt on road maintenance west of Jenin""",3/12/21 12:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123632,"
JENIN, Friday, March 12, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today ordered a halt on the maintenance of the road of Umm Ar-Rihan village, west of the northern West Bank district of Jenin, according to an official.
Member of Umm al-Rihan Village Council, Bilal Zaid, told WAFA that staff of the Israeli Nature Protection Authority handed the council a notification to stop the maintenance of the road, which leads to al-Butmeh neighborhood of the village.
He noted that the maintenance works for the road were stopped although paving the base course layer does not contradict with nature preservation laws.
Located some five kilometers to the northeast of Barta‘a Ash-Sharqiya village, Umm Ar-Rihan is one of the seven village forming the Barta‘a enclave and has a population of some 500. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given full control over a tiny pocket of land accounting for 6.6 percent of the village area, classified as Area A, and full control over 25.8 percent, classified as Area B. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
The Israeli occupation authorities have seized large tracts of land and uprooted thousands of fruit trees from the village and nearby villages for the construction of four Israeli colonial settlements, located within its boundaries, including the Shaked and Hinnanit settlements.
Designating an area as a nature reserve may convey the impression that Israel wishes to protest the environment. In practice, however, Israeli has been using such designations for advancing the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

"Israel orders PA Governor of Jerusalem not to communicate with President Abbas""",3/11/21 21:32,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123630,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, March 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today handed the Palestinian Authority's Governor of Jerusalem Adnan Gheith an order banning him from communicating with President Mahmoud Abbas and another 50 Palestinian dignitaries.
The order also bans him from making any contacts with Members of the Fatah Central Committee, as well as many other Palestinian high-ranking security and political figures.
The Jerusalem Governor was informed of this order today when he was summoned for questioning by the Israeli intelligence at the Russian Compound in occupied Jerusalem.
Gheith is already denied movement outside his place of residence in the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan.
Commenting on the Israeli decision, Gheith said, ""This decision will not prevent us from practicing our duty of continuing to do everything possible to achieve freedom, independence and establish the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.""
Since he assumed his current office as Governor of Jerusalem in August 2018, the Palestinian Authority official was arrested or briefly detained by Israeli occupation forces at least 18 times.
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it in a move never recognized by the international community.
The people of Palestine consider Jerusalem as the de jure capital of their state, although the city remains under Israeli occupation until today.

"Jerusalem NGO warns: 100 residential buildings in Silwan at imminent risk of Israeli demolition""",3/11/21 20:02,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123629,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, March 11, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli municipality of Jerusalem has just cancelled all its previous agreements with Palestinian citizens of Al-Bustan Quarter, in the occupied Jerusalem neighbourhood of Silwan, and rejected masterplans it had requested from them as an alternative to demolition, according to the Silwan Defense Committee.
Fakhri Abu Diab, spokesman for the Committee, said the Israeli municipality has submitted an objection to the community’s requests to freeze the demolition orders and is asking the municipal court to authorise demolition. 
According to the municipality’s objections, it does not accept the masterplan prepared by Professor Yosef Jabareen (Urban and Regional Planning Track, Assoc. Dean for Research at Haifa Technion) nor a previous agreement between the municipality and the community. The community is now awaiting the municipal court decision regarding demolition.
Abu Diab added that those masterplans, in addition to the legal and other fees, have cost the community over $500,000 since 2011.
Diab pointed out that the municipality has informed the Al-Bustan’s lawyer, Adv. Ziad Qawar, that it has now abandoned its agreement not to demolish, and that it will demolish homes in the neighbourhood, to establish a biblical national park “The King’s Garden” - named on the basis that King David once walked in Bustan. This will be an extension of the City of David site and other local militant settlements which increasingly threaten and disrupt Silwan. 
According to the Committee, the imminent demolition of the 100 homes in Silwan’s Al-Bustan will displace 1550 people, most of whom are women and children.
""This mass demolition, if not stopped, will set a dangerous precedent for changing the municipality's policies from individual to mass demolition and will be seen by East Jerusalem Palestinians as marking the start of demolition, displacement and transfer of entire neighbourhoods in Jerusalem in order to empty the city of its Palestinian residents,"" Abu Diab said. ""It is a blatant challenge to the international community, to international law and to the International Criminal Court, as well as to the new, Biden Administration.""
He continued, “There is much fear and apprehension among residents. We appeal to the international diplomatic community, to human rights organisations and solidarity activists to prevent the West Jerusalem municipality from demolishing our homes and expelling us.”
In 2005, the Israeli municipality launched its “Kings Garden” plan to demolish the entire Al-Bustan. The extensive campaign against demolition involved a Knesset committee hearing, public committee meetings at the municipality, where aerial views of Al-Bustan tried to prove that the area was vacant in 1967, by photo-shopping people’s homes and replacing them with trees, despite many of the residents having been born in those homes many years earlier. 
In 2011, the municipality entered into an agreement with the citizens, calling on them to present alternative plans for the neighbourhood, which they did – as engineered by Prof. Jabareen.

"Settlers fire at two children south of Hebron""",3/11/21 17:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123628,"
HEBRON, Thursday, March 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian children survived death today when they were fired at by a group of fanatic Israeli settlers near the town of Yatta in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Rateb Jabour, coordinator of the Wall and Colonization Resistance Commission in Hebron, told WAFA that armed settlers opened gunfire towards two children from Hrezat family while they were grazing sheep in the area of Masafer Yatta. 
The two children, said to be 12 and 13 years old respectively, survived the attack, and were able to leave to a safe haven.
In the meantime, Israeli occupation forces raided the village of Karmel, one of the hamlets of Masafer Yatta area, and stormed and searched the homes of local Palestinian residents, wreaking havoc behind.
The area of Masafer Yatta, a collection of about 19 nomadic Bedouin hamlets, have been a frequent target of almost daily assaults by the Israeli military and settlers, who wish to empty the area of its indigenous population for settlement expansion purposes.
Almost everyday, attacks by the Israeli occupation forces or settlers on Palestinians are reported in the area.

"Settlers storm Islamic shrines in Salfit-district town """,3/11/21 09:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123620,"
SALFIT, Thursday, March 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Scores of Israeli settlers Wednesday night stormed ancient Islamic sites in Kifl Haris town, north of the West Bank city of Salfit, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli forces closed the town entrances to provide protection for the settlers who proceeded to break into and desecrate the Prophet Thu Al-Kifl, Prophet Thu An-Noon and Prophet Yosha shrines, causing a state of tension among the town residents.
The raid lasted from 10:30 PM on Wednesday night to dawn Thursday, during which the settlers performed rituals at the shrines. 
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
Located some five kilometers to the north of Salfit city, Kifl Haris has a population of some 4,450 and occupies a total area of some 9,300 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over 42 percent of the village total area, classified as area B, which constitutes of the built-up area of the village. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C, which constitutes mostly of agricultural areas, open spaces and lands confiscated for colonial settlements.
Israel has seized large tracts of the village land for the construction of Ariel, the second largest colonial settlement in the West Bank in terms of area. It has confiscated more land for the construction of settler-only by-pass Road 5 and Road 505, which extend for 4.6 kilometers on the village’s land.

HEBRON, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli occupation forces today detained five Palestinian children between the ages of 7 and 11, including three brothers, while they were picking akoub (gundelia plant) in Masafer Yatta area in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
They told WAFA that the five children were first chased away by Israeli settlers from the land where they were picking the plant that is used as meals in the Palestinian kitchen before calling the army who detained the five children.
The children were taken to a police station in the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.

"Israel to demolish house under construction east of Bethlehem""",3/10/21 13:36,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123612,"
BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today notified to demolish a house under construction in Wadi Abu al-Hummus, east of Bethlehem, according to an official.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Office, Hassan Breijah, told WAFA that Israeli forces stormed the vicinity of Murad Tourist Resort in Wadi Abu al-Hummus, where they handed Amjad Ja‘abis a notification to tear down his house purportedly for being built without a license.
He added that the occupation authorities intend carry out the demolition although the house under construction, which occupies 200 square meters, is located within Area B, which under the administrative control of the Palestinian Authority, and the house owner, Amjad, has obtained a building license from the Palestinian Ministry of Local Government. 
In July 2019, Israeli forces took measurements to demolish 16 buildings, comprising 100 apartments, under the pretext of being “close to the annexation wall” and “posing a security threat” due to their proximity to the wall.
Palestinians have slammed demolitions of their property in the area as part of the ongoing systematic policy of forcible transfer and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.

"Israeli settlers raid archeological site near Nablus""",3/10/21 13:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123611,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) – A group of Israeli settlers today stormed the archaeological site of Sebastia, north of Nablus city, according to a local source.
Sebastia mayor, Mohammad Azzem, told WAFA that Israeli forces closed off the area and occupied the rooftops of some buildings to provide protection for the settlers, who forced their way into the site in three batches. 
He added that despite the general lockdown declared by the Palestinian government to curb the spread of the coronavirus cases, Israel is reckless enough to allow dozens of settlers into the site, posing dangers to its residents.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli forces demolish structures, injure villagers near Nablus""",3/10/21 11:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123609,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning demolished several structures in Eyn Shibli village, east of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, according to an official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers into the village, where the heavy machineries tore down several shops, covering an area of 500 square meters and belonging to Jamal al-Omari, and his brother, Mazen.
Confrontations erupted when the villagers confronted the demolition operation and the Israeli troops opened fire towards them. Several villagers got suffocated due to inhaling the tear gas. 
Located some 16 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Ein Shibli currently has a population of some 350 and occupies an approximate area of 770 dunams. Its villager are originally refugees who were driven out of their homes in Jaffa and al-Hamma village in what is become known as Israel in 1948.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a pocket of land accounting for almost 68 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
The village is flanked by the Beqaot and Hamra Israeli colonial settlements, located to the east and south of the village, as well as the Beqaot military base to the east of the village.
Israel has also set to two military checkpoints; the Hamra permanent checkpoint and al-Badhan temporary checkpoint, to the east and west of the village, and seized part of the village land for constructing the Israeli bypass Road No. 57, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Settlers assault farmer, his wife in natural area near Salfit""",3/10/21 10:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123607,"
SALFIT, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday evening assaulted a Palestinian farmer and his wife in Wadi Qana area, north of Deit Istya town, northwest of Salfit city, according to an official.
Mayor of Deir Istiya, Sa‘id Zeidan, told WAFA that some 80 settlers forced their way into the nature reserve, where they hurled stones at Jihad Mansour, a local farmer, and his wife. 
Several other farmers and livestock herders intervened and confronted the settlers. 
According to Baladi Rooted Resistance, a series of stories of Palestinians resisting the Israeli colonization and occupational with seeds and homegrown vegetables, Wadi Qana is considered one of the most beautiful natural areas in the occupied West Bank.
It is an important nature reserve boasting both fauna and flora. With its numerous springs, the valley has historically served agricultural and recreational purposes for Palestinians who live in the area, mainly from the adjacent village of Deir Istiya in the northwestern region of the West Bank.
The growth of Israeli settlements brought dramatic changes, starting in the late 1970s. Until the 1990s, almost 50 Palestinian families, around 350 people, lived in the valley. They started to leave for Deir Istiya because of water pollution.
Israel declared Wadi Qana to be an Israeli nature reserve in 1983. They called it Nahal Qana Reserve, an area of nearly 3,500 acres, and placed it under the authority of four Israeli governing entities, including the settlement of Karnei Shomron and the Civil Administration, the bureaucratic arm of Israel’s military occupation.
Palestinians, who have been working in the valley for generations, face increasing Israeli restrictions on their farming and grazing practices. Today, they cannot develop their infrastructure, except to tend some seasonal crops.
The construction of Israel’s wall poses a further threat to Palestinian farmers. According to UN maps, Wadi Qana will be left on the western side of the wall, and de facto annexed to Israel, separating landowners in Deir Istiya village from the valley.

"Israeli navy targets Palestinian fishing boats off Gaza coast""",3/10/21 09:47,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123606,"
GAZA, Wednesday, March 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy Wednesday morning targeted Palestinian fishing boats sailing offshore Gaza city, WAFA correspondent reported.
He said that the navy opened gunfire and water hoses at Palestinian fishing boats sailing within six nautical miles offshore the city, causing damage to at least one boat. 
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Palestinian teen killed, another critically injured in Arab town inside Israel """,3/9/21 21:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123604,"
JALJULIA, Tuesday, March 09, 2021 (WAFA) - A fifteen-year-old Palestinian teen was shot and killed, and another aged 12, was critically injured in yet another criminal incident inside a Palestinian community in the Palestinian land occupied since 1948.
A fifteen-year-old teen was shot dead and a twelve-year-old was seriously injured from gunshots fired at them by an assailant in the Arab town of Jaljulia, in a continuing wave of gun violence and organized crime, blamed for Israeli police's inaction to sue perpetrators and hold them to account.
With the rise in violence and unchecked crime in Arab towns inside Israel, Palestinians there, who make up more than 20 percent of Israel's population, have been protesting for the eighth consecutive week against the escalation of violence in Arab communities in Israel and the failure of the Israeli police to put a stop to the rise in crime.
Palestinians with Israeli citizenship blame the crime wave crisis on Israeli police inaction, saying that police do not enforce the law in Arab cities and towns. They say that the absence of the rule of law has enabled illegal weapons, protection networks, and organized crime organizations to spread freely in Arab communities.

The activist said Palestinian shepherd ‘Ala Iti’mat was herding his sheep in the pastures to the east of yatta town when an explosive device left behind by the Israeli occupation army went off, causing him moderate injuries which necessitated his transfer for treatment. 
The Israeli army often conducts drills in the occupied West Bank, especially in the Jordan Valley, after forcefully displacing dozens of local Palestinian families due to the proximity of their homes to the training sites.
Palestinians living in these areas have to also worry about unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli army after the drills, which have led to the death of many Palestinians, including children, over the past years.

NABLUS, Monday, March 8, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today ordered a halt on the construction of three houses in Zawata village, northwest of Nablus city, according to an official.
Head of Zawata Village Council, Hafeth ‘Elwi, said that Israeli forces stormed the northwestern part of the village, where they posted notices ordering a halt on the construction of three houses, including two in the finishing phase.
Israel refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

He said that Israeli soldiers forced their way into the town, sparking violent confrontations.
Soldier opened fire towards local youngsters, hitting one protestor in the foot and seriously injuring another in the pelvis.
Both casualties were rushed to hospitals for urgent treatment.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

RAMALLAH, Monday, March 8, 2021 (WAFA) – The Education Ministry today threatened to deal firmly with any school embracing the Israeli curriculum in the occupied city of Jerusalem. 
The Ministry reiterated its rejection of any attempt to adopt the Israeli curriculum, including subjects such as history which are viewed by Palestinians as tantamount to adopting the historical narrative of the enemy, in Palestinian schools.
It threatened to hold any party accountable for encouraging the attempts to introduce the Israeli textbooks in Palestinian private schools in the city due to the national, educational and legal risks posed to the Palestinian question. 
It called upon the civil society organizations to take a firm stance on attempts aimed at undermining the Palestinian education system in the city.
The Israeli occupation authorities have been relentlessly attempting to push their curriculum in Palestinian schools in return for pledges of financial support, and have been doing so under the guise of closing the gaps in education, poverty and unemployment that have afflicted Jerusalemite Palestinians.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

The soldiers also destroyed building material that was in the vicinity of the demolished house.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, March 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israelis demonstrated on Saturday evening in Jerusalem and in other locations across the country demanding resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a corruption trial and accusations of mishandling the coronavirus crisis.
Smaller protests also took part in other parts at overpasses and outside Netanyahu's private house in the upscale town of Caesaria.
At the main rally in Jerusalem, protesters gathered at the entrance of the city and marched to Netanyahu's official residence, holding Israeli flags and black flags symbolizing one of the protest movements. “Enough with Division!” and “This is not politics, this is crime” read some of the placards.
Protesters in Tel Aviv and Caesarea chanted slogans against Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption and fraud.
One protester was reportedly assaulted by Netanyahu supporters near Moshav Yavne'el settlement. ""Two haredi young men walked past us and started tearing down signs .. one of them attacked a protester, tossed her glasses and her phone ... she was bleeding from her nose,"" a protester told journalists.
Demonstrators have been holding regular protests for months against Netanyahu, demanding his resignation over his trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.

"Occupation forces open fire at fishermen, herders in Gaza""",3/7/21 08:41,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123559,"
GAZA, Sunday, March 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy and forces opened fire today at Palestinian fishermen sailing off Gaza City and at herders to the east of Khan Younis in two separate incidents, said local sources.
Israeli naval boats opened fire and water cannons on fishermen while sailing at about three nautical miles from the shore, causing partial damage to at least one boat and forcing fishermen to return to the shore.
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation soldiers stationed at military watchtowers along the Gaza perimeter fence to the east of Khan Younis, south of the Strip, opened random fire toward Palestinian herders as they were grazing their herds in the area. No injuries were reported.
The Israeli occupation army does not allow Palestinians to be within 300 meters from the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip, which it unilaterally declared as a buffer zone, and often opens fire at the farmers and whoever reaches those areas.
Israeli navy harassment of Palestinian fishermen off Gaza is an also a daily occurrence, and aims at undermining the fishing industry in Gaza, a vital source of income to thousands of families there.

SALFIT, Saturday, March 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settler vandals attacked a Palestinian family today while they were present in their own farm outside the village of Bruqin, near the town of Salfit in the occupied West Bank. No injuries were reported, local sources said.
Vandals from the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Brukhin physically attacked the family of Mr. Hatem Othman al-Hajj, a local Palestinian villager, while the family were enjoying a picnic to their own farm. The settlers also smashed the windshield of their parked vehicle before citizens were able to fend off the attack and push the attacking settlers back.
No injuries were reported.
Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians across the occupied West Bank have become a daily occurrence, and are promoted and encouraged by the culture of impunity granted by the occupying authorities.

"Israel takes over 658 dunams of Palestinian land in Bethlehem""",3/6/21 21:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123556,"
BETHLEHEM, Saturday, March 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities issued today a military order expropriating 658 dunams of Palestinian land in the village of al-Ubeidiya, located about 4 kilometers east of Bethlehem city in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to the Jerusalem-based Applied Research Institute (ARIJ).
ARIJ said the land confiscated by the arbitrary Israeli takeover decision will be used for a water collection project that will only serve the colonial Israeli settler communities in the area.
There are over 700,000 colonial Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
According to Israeli rights group B'Tselem, Israel has used a complex legal and bureaucratic mechanism to take control of more Palestinian land in the West Bank. 
The principal tool used to take control of land is to declare it ""state land."" This process began in 1979 and is based on a manipulative implementation of the Ottoman Lands Law of 1858. Other methods employed by Israel to take control of land include seizure for military needs, declaration of land as ""abandoned assets,"" and the expropriation of land for public needs.

"Settlers chop off olive trees, assault farmers in Bethlehem""",3/6/21 16:46,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123555,"
BETHLEHEM, Saturday, March 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers today chopped off 15 olive trees and assaulted farmers during two separate incidents in the occupied West Bank district of Bethlehem, according to local sources.
In the village of Artas, southwest of Bethlehem, settlers from the illegal settlement bloc of Etzion broke into a ranch belonging to Mr. Jamal Abdullah Ismail, a local Palestinian farmer, and chopped off 15 olive trees belonging to him, according to Hasan Breijeyeh, director of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission in Bethlehem.
In the nearby village of Kisan, settlers protected by a military escort assaulted a number of farmers while working in their own lands near the village and forced them to leave at gunpoint, said the deputy mayor of the village, Ahmad Gazal.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
It includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, and others.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

"Peace Now: 500 words determine fate of seven Palestinian families in an East Jerusalem neighbourhood""",3/6/21 14:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123553,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, March 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Approximately 500 words was all what the judges of the Jerusalem District Court needed to determine the fate of seven Palestinian families with 31 people, eight of them are children, in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, according to the Israeli Peace Now movement.
The court ruled on Wednesday that the Palestinian families should vacate their homes by August 1st, 2021 in favor of Israeli settlers.
Three weeks ago, the same court rejected another appeal by six other families against their eviction from their homes and in a few rows determined that they should leave their houses in favor of the settlers.
This way, in less than one month, the Jerusalem District Court ordered the eviction of 58 people, 17 of them children, from 13 houses in Sheikh Jarrah, despite the fact that all of them legally settled in their homes, in an official agreement with the Jordanian government which built the houses for them at the 1950s.
The lawsuit is part of an organized move designed to dispossess a Palestinian community of its home and establish a settlement in Sheikh Jarrah in its place, said Peace Now. Hundreds of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah are in a similar situation in court proceedings, and hundreds more in Batan al-Hawa in Silwan neighborhood.
Advocate Sami Arsheid, who represents the families, confirmed after the hearing of the appeal on Monday that the issue of the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan is one of the items of the complaint filed by the Palestinians to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, declared earlier last week the initiation of an investigation respecting the situation of Palestine.
Since the beginning of 2020 to the present day, judgments have been given in 14 eviction claims of Israeli settlers against Palestinian families in the Batan al-Hawa in Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah. In the rulings, the Israeli Magistrate’s Court ordered the evacuation of 33 families with 165 people, including dozens of children - seven cases in the Batan al-Hawa for the evacuation of 107 people from 20 families; seven cases in Sheikh Jarrah for the evacuation of 58 people from 13 families.
All the families have filed appeals and are in various stages of hearing in the district court, and some even in the Supreme Court.
Dozens more families are in proceedings and may receive evictions soon. If the government does not stop the move, there might be massive evictions of families in the coming months, warned Peace Now.
""The story here is not legal but political. The court is only the tool by which settlers use with the close assistance of state authorities to commit the crime of displacing an entire community and replacing it with a settlement. The Israeli government and settlers have no problem to displace thousands of Palestinians in the name of ‘the Right of Return’ to properties before 1948, while they strongly claim that the millions of Israelis living in Palestinian properties before 1948 cannot be evicted. Since the evacuation of the Mughrabi neighborhood for the purpose of expanding the Western Wall (Al-Buraq) plaza in 1967, there has been no such deportation in Jerusalem. On the table of the prosecution in the ICC in The Hague is a complaint about the displacement process led by the government in Sheikh Jarrah and in Batan al-Hawa. The government can still stop this injustice,"" said Peace Now.
The eviction lawsuits against the families of Dajani (11 individuals), Dahudi (2 individuals) and Hammad (18 individuals) were filed by a company called ""Nahalat Shimon"", owned by a foreign company registered in Delaware (USA), which represents settlers seeking to build a large settlement in Sheikh Jarrah. The settlers purchased the land from two Jewish associations, the Sephardi Community Committee and the Knesset Israel Committee, which claimed to have purchased the land at the end of the 19th century.
In 1948 the land, which was then without structures, came under Jordanian rule. The Jordanians designated the land for the resettlement of dozens of Palestinian refugee families, who exchanged their refugee status for homes in the newly-built neighborhood in Sheikh Jarrah. After 1967, the Jewish organizations recovered the ownership rights of the land based on the Legal and Administrative Matters Law and began to demand that the refugee families vacate their homes. To that extent, the associations were exercising the ""right of return"" of Jews to assets taken in 1948, a right not afforded to Palestinians.
In recent years, the Nahalat Shimon settler company has filed numerous lawsuits against dozens of families in Sheikh Jarrah in the Karem Ja’uni area, which are in various stages of court hearings.
Recently, eviction procedures against the Sabbagh family were renewed after losing in court to the settlers in a similar lawsuit.
The settlement of Karem Ja’uni began in 2008 when the Al Kurd family was evicted from its home and in 2009 the Rawi and Hanoun families, and part of another al-Kurd family. Beforehand, in the late 1990s, settlers took over a few Palestinian-owned houses near Karem Ja’uni, built in the 1950s on land claimed to have been owned by Jews before 1948.
Apart from the Sabbagh, Dajani, Dahudi and Hammad families, there are at least seven additional eviction cases dealing with dozens of families in various stages of court hearings in Karem Ja’uni. On the western side of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, in Um Haroun, there are another few dozens of families facing eviction lawsuits by settlers, and in Batan al-Hawa in Silwan there are almost 100 families at risk of eviction.

"Palestinians suffocate as Israeli forces suppress Kufr Qaddoum weekly march""",3/5/21 15:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123541,"
QALQILIA, Friday, March 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Several Palestinians suffocated today by tear gas during the Israeli army crackdown on the weekly anti-settlements protest in the northern West Bank village of Kufr Qaddoum, according to the coordinator of the popular resistance committee in the village, Murab Shtawi.
Israeli forces suppressed demonstrators who also rallied to protest Israel’s closure of the main road that connects the village of Kufr Qaddoum with the city of Nablus since 2003.
Forces used rubber-coated metal bullets, tear gas canisters, and stun grenades against protesters, causing several suffocation cases among them. They were all treated at the scene.
“Before 2003, the residents of Kufr Qaddum would use a shorter road to the east in order to come and go to nearby cities and villages. However, as the settlements expanded so that they overwhelmed the road, it became closed for Palestinian use, said Addameer Human rights Association.
The only alternative road is roughly six times longer than the previous route, disrupting the villagers’ ability to attend university, their jobs, and other vital aspects of their economic and social wellbeing, noted Addameer.
Although Kufr Qaddum’s Popular Resistance Committee took their case to the Israeli High Court in 2003, the legal status of the road remains unchanged, stressed Addameer.
After all legal appeals failed, villagers decided to organize weekly demonstrations in July 2011, a step that was met with violent suppression by Israeli forces.

"Israeli navy targets fishermen offshore Gaza, injures two """,3/5/21 12:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123538,"
BEIT LAHIA, Friday, March 5, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy today targeted Palestinian fishermen offshore Beit Lahia town in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, injuring two fishermen, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that the fishermen were sailing only three nautical miles offshore the area when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire towards them, injuring two.
The casualties were rushed to the Indonesian Hospital, east of the town, where medics described their condition as light and moderate.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israel approves a settler-only elevator at Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque""",3/4/21 22:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123534,"
HEBRON, Thursday, March 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel's supreme court approved today a license for the installation of an elevator next to the flashpoint Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, which would only serve Israeli settlers.
Imad Hamdan, director of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee, told WAFA that the decision was aimed at Judaizing the holy site and altering its historical characters. He added that while Israel claims that the purpose of the elevator is purely humanitarian, the real intention is to take over as much area as possible in the courtyards of the mosque in favor of the settler community in the city.
On February 10, lawyers of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee won an injunction from the same court suspending the installation of the said elevator until a final judgment into the case.
Tawfiq Jahshan, a lawyer of the Committee, said the Israeli supreme court held yesterday a session on the case wherein the lawyers of the Committee submitted legal defense against the installation of the elevator. He pointed out that due to the change of the court's judges, the court approved the confiscation of around 300 square meters in the courtyards of the mosque for the purpose of the elevator.
Last May, Israeli ""Defense"" Minister Naftali Bennett issued an expropriation order for a portion of the Ibrahimi Mosque as part of a project to build the elevator to facilitate settlers' access to the Muslim house of worship.
The Hebron Municipality has been demanding that the project should be stopped because the construction will be on land it owns together with the Palestinian Waqf (Religious Endowment) Islamic Trust.
All of the Israeli settlements and settlers on Palestinian land are illegal according to international law.

JERUSALEM, Thursday, March 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces tore down today a tent, which was set up two weeks ago by members of the Elian family in the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of al-Isawiya on the rubble of their home, which was demolished by the Israeli municipality at that time.
Staff from the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem accompanied by a police escort broke into the tent, cordoned off the area, asked its residents to leave and proceeded to tear it down.
The family had set up the tent as a temporary shelter on the rubble of their demolished home. 
Israel denies permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to expand existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
On the other hand, Israel builds thousands of housing units for Israeli-only illegal settlements spread throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

SALFIT, Thursday, March 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers destroyed today a barn owned by a Palestinian farmer in the village of Kafr al-Dik, near the town of Salfit in the occupied West bank, according to local sources.
Fanatic settlers from the illegal settlement of Brukhin sneaked into the land of Mr. Shadi Saeed, a local Palestinian farmer, and destroyed the walls of the barn using handheld machinery. The settlers also vandalized other farming content that was available inside the barn.
Violence and vandalism by Israeli settlers are commonplace across the occupied West Bank, and are rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities as the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction over Israeli settlers. 
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

Rateb Jabour, an activist with the anti-settlement committees, said the military informed seven residents of the village of Maeen, east of Yatta, of its decision to demolish their homes, which each range in area between 130 and 160 square meters.
Dozens of other village homes have already been demolished under the same pretext of construction without a permit.
Maeen is located in what is classified as Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military control preserved for its settlement activities and where its Palestinian residents are not allowed to build or develop.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, March 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities Wednesday morning demolished a Palestinian house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Shufat refugee camp, according to local sources.
They said that a sizable Israeli police force escorted two bulldozers into the camp, where the heavy machineries tore down a two-storey house belonging to a member of the Abu Mayala family purportedly for being built without a license.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Palestinian rights organizations call for boycotting Israeli military courts in the occupied territories""",3/2/21 15:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123498,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, March 2, 2021 (WAFA) – Several Palestinian rights organizations today held a rally outside the Israeli Ofer military camp and detention center west of Ramallah calling for a boycott of the Israeli military courts.
The organizations, which defend the rights of Palestinian political prisoners in Israel, accused the courts of being a tool in the hands of the Israeli occupation authorities to suppress the Palestinian people and do not guarantee a fair trial.
These courts are a tool in the hands of the occupation authorities to impose greater control and domination over the Palestinians, whether by absence of a fair trial, arbitrary and administrative detention, the arrest of children, the imposition of fines, torture of detainees, and other crimes committed on a daily basis, said Sahar Francis, head of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association.
Qaddoura Faris, head of the Palestinian Prisoner Society, said boycotting the courts is important because they are responsible for the suppression of the Palestinian people while legitimizing the illegal acts of the occupation authorities. Some of these acts can be considered war crimes, he said.
Shaawan Jabarin, head of Al-Haq, said the time has come to fully expose these courts at the international level and to consider their leaders as war criminals.

The local priest managed to extinguish the fire quickly. Recordings of surveillance cameras showed Orthodox Jewish fundamentalists attempting to set the monastery entrance on fire.
""This act of vandalism is the fourth in a month that targeted the same monastery; according to the authorities, some religious Orthodox Jews are suspected as the probable assailants,"" ACOHL said in a statement.
ACOHL condemned the ""offensive"" attack which undermines peaceful coexistence among different religious communities.
""We, Catholic Churches, unite with the Orthodox Churches and all other Christian communities of Jerusalem and strongly condemn such acts of vandalism that offend not only the life of Christians but also of many who still believe in dialogue and mutual respect. These acts are contrary to the spirit of peaceful coexistence among the different religious communities of the City,"" it said.
It demanded that the Israeli authorities open a serious investigation into the attack and prosecute the assailants.
""All political and religious authorities of the City should unite in condemning these acts so frequent in these last months in Jerusalem. For that reason, we demand the Israeli security authorities investigate these incidents seriously and bring assailants to justice,"" it added.
""These acts and the rationale behind them prove, yet again, that it is necessary and urgent to work to make sure that all educational institutions in the Country educate their pupils on tolerance and respect to other religions, communities, and nations,"" it said.
""We pray to the Almighty for granting wisdom to learn to live alongside each other, respecting each other's dignity and rights,"" the Assembly concluded.

Sources told WAFA Israeli forces detained Majd Baida, 15, after severally beating him up while he was present near the metal gate to the south of the town of Jayyous.
Israel has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world that automatically and systematically detains and prosecutes children in military courts that lack fundamental fair trial rights and protections. 
Israel detains and prosecutes between 500 and 700 Palestinian children in military courts each year. Nearly three out of four Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces experiences some form of physical violence, according to documentation collected by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCI-Palestine).
While international law demands that children only be detained as a measure of last resort, custodial pre-trial detention is the norm for Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces from the occupied West Bank.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, February 28, 2021 (WAFA) – In reaction to Israel’s announcement on sending surplus vaccines to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Honduras, and Guatemala, Oxfam Acting Country Director in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Dina Jibril has described the deal as ""shameful"", as millions of Palestinians are left to wait.
""Israel's deal to exchange surplus vaccines for UN votes and embassies, while the vast majority of almost 5 million Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza are left to wait for the potentially life-saving vaccine, is shameful and shortsighted,"" said Jibril in a statement.
She added, ""Shipping excess vaccine stocks across the world while Palestinians living, in many cases, only a few hundred meters away from vaccinated Israelis is yet another example of the Israeli government’s refusal to fulfill its legal obligation as an occupying power."" 
Jibril stressed that the occupying state had ""a moral and public health imperatives to ensure all Palestinians have access to adequate, basic services including healthcare. Israel must direct its efforts to ensure an urgent, free vaccination campaign for all Palestinians."" 
""Once again Israel's treatment of Palestinians not only endangers Palestinians’ health and prioritizes politics over people, this short-term thinking harms Israel’s own long-term interests too.

HEBRON, Friday, February 26, 2021 (WAFA) – Scores of Palestinians Friday afternoon suffocated as Israeli forces quelled a rally in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli troops cracked down on a rally marking the 27th anniversary of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and denouncing the Israeli intrusions upon the site, causing dozens to suffer from the effects of tear gas inhalation.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.

Approximately two months ago, settlers set up a tent and a water tank and embarked on razing Palestinian land in the area as a prelude for the construction of the new colonial outpost.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights following the 1967 war, and has since built hundreds of illegal Jewish-only settlements throughout the occupied territories.
Israel’s nation-state law states that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

They said that Israeli forces forced their way into the town and closed the town entrances to provide protection for the settlers who proceeded to desecrate and perform rituals in Prophet Thu al Kifl, Prophet Thu an Noon and Prophet Yosha shrines, causing a state of tension among the town residents.
Located some five kilometers to the north of Salfit city, Kifl Haris has a population of some 4,450 and occupies a total area of some 9,300 dunams. 
Israel has seized large tracts of the village land for the construction of Ariel, the second largest colonial settlement in the West Bank in terms of area.

"Israel takes over 193 dunams of Palestinian land for a landfill""",2/25/21 16:06,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123435,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, February 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities announced today their takeover of 193 dunams of Palestinian-owned land belonging to the village of Deir Dibwan, east of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, in favor of the establishment of a landfill that will serve Israeli settlements, according to the village's mayor.
Mansour Mansour told reporters that a map recently published by the Israeli occupation authorities shows that a total of 193 dunams of land belonging to the village and the neighboring village of Rammun have been taken over for the purpose of creating the landfill, which will only serve colonial Israeli settlements in the area.
He said the land confiscation policy has been and will continue to be rejected by the Palestinian landowners, who will do whatever possible to stop the land theft.
There are about 700,000 colonial Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank settlements in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
The occupying state of Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights following the 1967 war, and has since built hundreds of illegal Jewish-only settlements throughout the occupied territories.

Ahmad Ghazal, deputy head of Kisan village council, told WAFA that settlers, backed by soldiers, detained the shepherd and his sister while attending to their sheep in open pastures east of Kisan village, east of Bethlehem.
He said the settlers and the soldiers have refused to let them go before issuing a fine for herding in the open pastures.
Kisan shepherds are often attacked and harassed by soldiers and settlers who also let their dogs attack and kill the sheep, considered the only source of living for the shepherds.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, February 24, 2021 (WAFA) - The Humanitarian Coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory, Lynn Hastings, today called on Israel to halt all demolitions of Palestinian homes and possessions and to allow the humanitarian community to provide shelter, food and water to the vulnerable Palestinian communities living in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under Israeli military control.
Hastings’ statement came a day after visiting the community of Humsa al-Baqaia, in the northern Jordan Valley, where the homes and belongings of the families living there were either demolished or seized by Israel five times in the last month in an effort to drive them out of their homes and lands.
Tents, food, water tanks and fodder for the community’s livestock have all been confiscated despite repeated calls by the international community for these actions to stop in accordance with international law, said Hastings.
""As we have noted previously, situations where communities are put under pressure to move raises a real risk of forcible transfer,"" said the Humanitarian Coordinator.
""Although the Humsa al-Baqaia community has exhausted its recourse through the domestic legal process, in accordance with international law, the Israeli authorities should immediately halt all further demolitions of Palestinian homes and possessions, allow the humanitarian community to provide shelter, food and water to this most vulnerable group and these people to remain in their homes,"" concluded the statement.

Ghassan Daghlas, a local official who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activity in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers broke into a sheep barn belonging to Hisham Hamoud in the village, caused damage to the barn and a shack and eventually managed to steal seven sheep.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement outpost of Ahiya, constructed on confiscated Palestinian land.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Over 700,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.

GAZA, Wednesday, February 24, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli navy Wednesday morning attacked Palestinian fishing boats sailing offshore the city of Gaza, WAFA correspondent reported.
He said that the Israeli navy opened fire and water hoses at Palestinian fishing boats sailing within six nautical miles offshore Gaza city, causing damages to the boats. 
The fishermen had to leave the water and abruptly end their fishing mission, which is their sole source of livelihood. 
Meanwhile, Israeli forces manning Gaza’s frontier opened fire at Palestinian farmers and shepherds who were tending their groves and flocks to the east of Khan Younes city, in the southern coastal enclave, forcing them to leave.
No casualties were reported though.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.

"Israel levels land east of Jerusalem to expand illegal settlement""",2/23/21 17:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123407,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, February 23, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli occupation authorities today leveled a large area of land in the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, southeast of occupied Jerusalem, in an effort to expand an illegal settlement, according to Bassam Bahar, head of the Committee for the Defense of Abu Dis Lands.
He told WAFA that the land, estimated at 1500 dunums (1.5 square kilometers), is located near the illegal Kedar settlement, built on land belonging to residents of Abu Dis.
He said that the occupation authorities prevent the landowners from working in it or reclaiming it since it falls within the Israeli settlement plan known as E1.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently gave the green light to start implementing this dangerous settlement project, strongly opposed by the international community because it would divide the West Bank in half.

Mutaz Bisharat, an official with the Tubas Governorate, said the soldiers raided the community this morning and removed the tents placed there with assistance from international donors to shelter the residents who were left homeless following the recent Israeli demolitions.
He said the forces seized as well four water tankers and four water tanks.
The army demolished Humsa al-Bqaia community four times this month under the pretext that the area is designated for army training and displaced its community with a plan to relocate them to another area.
Palestinians say the army training is only an excuse to remove the Palestinians in that area in order to develop it for Israel’s illegal settlement activity.

"Jerusalem homeowner accuses Israel of demolishing his house in reprisal for working as guard at Al-Aqsa Mosque""",2/22/21 14:36,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123394,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, February 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Fadi Ilayyan, whose two-story family building was demolished this morning in Isawiyya neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, accused the Israeli authorities of demolishing it for political reasons because he works as a guard at Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem.
Israeli forces today sealed off the area where the two-story, four-apartment building that houses four members of the Ilayyan family, and proceeded to demolish it leaving Fadi, his father and two siblings and their families of 17 persons, including 10 children, homeless.
While Israel claimed the demolition took place for lack of a building permit, Ilayyan said the location of the building was within a zoned area of the neighborhood where construction is allowed.
He said that Israeli police had detained him several times in the past during his work as a guard and banned him from entering Al-Aqsa Mosque compound where he works because he would stand up to attempts by Jewish fanatics to violate the visitation rules for non-Muslims at the holy compound, Islam’s third holiest site.
He said he was threatened several times by the police that they would demolish his house if he keeps working as a guard at the Mosque.
The house was built 10 years ago and during this time the West Jerusalem municipality and its mayor had promised the Ilayyan family members that they would eventually get a permit for the house when its papers are completed.
However, the family was surprised when it was informed yesterday by the Israeli security and not the municipality that its building and homes would be demolished on the next day despite the promise to get a permit, prompting Ilayyan to say the demolition was politically motivated, and not for construction without a permit.

JERUSALEM, Monday, February 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers today demolished two shops in Sur Baher, a Palestinian neighborhood south of occupied East Jerusalem, without prior notice, according to Mohammad Tarshan, owner of the shops.
He told WAFA that the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem demolished his two 60-square-meter shops, built more than 50 years ago, without informing him of the demolition decision.
The municipality last October demolished a second floor Tarshan had built on top of the shops under the pretext it was built without a permit.
Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem say they are forced to build without permit because the Israeli municipality rarely issues permits to the city’s Palestinian citizens as a way to reduce their number by forcing them to leave it and find accommodation and work elsewhere.

JERUSALEM, Monday, February 22, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today demolished a two-story, four-apartment residential building in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Isawiyya displacing, as a result, four families, including 12 children, according to local sources.
A reinforced Israeli force was deployed in the vicinity of the building, owned by the Ilayyan family, before a bulldozer tore it down, reducing it to rubble, purportedly for being constructed without a license.
Fadi Ilayyan told WAFA that the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem informed him yesterday that it is going to demolish the four-apartment building constructed 10 years ago and occupied by his family, along with his father and two brothers, Murad and Amjad, displacing 17 members of the Ilayyan family, including 10 children.
He added that the Israeli occupation authorities pressed ahead with the demolition to punish him for his work as a guard at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem although the building was located within the master plan of the built-up area of Isawiyya.
On August 8, an Israeli court rejected an appeal to freeze the demolition order against the building, effectively banning the Ilayyan family from completing the procedures to obtain the necessary license.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, February 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces detained today evening two Palestinian minor brother, ages six and eight, in the town of Hizma, northeast of occupied Jerusalem, according to Hizma media center.
Israeli forces detained two brothers who were identified as Aws, 8, and Mohammed, 6, Ghazi Najeeb, while they were present near their home in the town of Hizma.
Israel has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world that automatically and systematically detains and prosecutes children in military courts that lack fundamental fair trial rights and protections. Israel detains and prosecutes between 500 and 700 Palestinian children in military courts each year. Nearly three out of four Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces experiences some form of physical violence, according to documentation collected by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCI-Palestine).
Defense for Children International - Palestine has called on Israeli authorities to take immediate action to release all Palestinian child detainees in Israeli prisons due to the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 virus.
 “Israeli authorities must take immediate action to release all Palestinian child detainees in Israeli prisons and detention centers due to the increasing vulnerability created due to the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 virus and to safeguard their right to life, survival, development, and health in accordance with international law,” said DCI-Palestine.
While international law demands that children only be detained as a measure of last resort, custodial pre-trial detention is the norm for Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces from the occupied West Bank.

"Israel issues demolition notice against an apartment building near Jerusalem""",2/21/21 16:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123377,"
 
JERUSALEM, Sunday, February 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli authorities issued today a demolition notice against a two-story apartment building belonging o a Palestinian family near the al-Issawiya neighborhood in the occupied city of Jerusalem, according to one of the owners.
Fadi Elayyan, one of al-Aqsa mosque guards and one of the owners, told WAFA that the Israeli West Jerusalem municipality informed him of its intention to demolish his family's 370-square-meter apartment building tomorrow. The building was built 10 years ago and consists of four residential apartments.
It is inhabited by 17 people, including 12 children, and belongs to Elyyan, his two brothers, and their father.
He added that although the building falls within the outline plan in which construction is permitted in al-Issawiya, the Israeli authorities seek to demolish it as a means to clamp down on him and prevent him from working in Al-Aqsa mosque.
Last year, an Israeli court rejected an appeal to freeze the decision to demolish the building, after it suspended any possibility to continue licensing procedures by the family.
It is noteworthy that Elayyan was arrested several times and banned from entering the mosque, under the pretext of disrupting settlers' incursions and protesting against the Israeli soldiers' desecration of the prayer halls.

JERICHO, Thursday, February 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Dozens of Palestinians from the village of Al-Jiftlik, north of the occupied West Bank city of Jericho in the Jordan Valley region, today organized a sit-in to protest the Israeli authorities' cutting off electricity in the area for the third day in a row.
In a tent set near Road 90 near the village, the protesters raised Palestinian flags and demanded that electricity be reconnected to their village.
The head of Al-Jiftlik village Council, Ahmad Abu Ghanem, told WAFA that most of the village residents work in agriculture and livestock, and depend mainly on electricity for their livelihoods.
According to Ghanem, the area suffers from deliberate frequent blackouts by the Israeli authorities, which have so far caused significant financial losses to local farmers.
Over the years, Israeli occupation authorities have been trying to empty the Jordan Valley, a fertile strip of land which makes up one third of the area of the West Bank, of its indigenous Palestinian communities to make way for a de facto annexation of the area to Israel's sovereignty.

Israeli police officers reportedly fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas canisters at a group of young men who were playing with snow, injuring three of them and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) said an ambulance of its own sustained minor damages after being targeted by the Israeli police.
At least two Palestinians were detained by the occupying forces during the raid on al-Isawiya.
For almost three years now, al-Isawiya has been a frequent target of daily Israeli police assaults.

"Israeli military breaches Gaza border, razes lands, and floods farmland with rainwater""",2/18/21 12:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123334,"
GAZA, Thursday, February 18, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli military today breached Gaza’s borders east of Deir al-Balah city in the central Gaza Strip, and razed farmlands. At the same time, Israel flooded farmlands east of Gaza City after it emptied basins collecting rainwater, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that four Israeli military bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of Wadi al-Salaqa town, south of Deir al-Balah, and leveled large tracts of farmland.
Israel often infiltrates Gaza borders and levels lands reaching some 300 meters inside the Gaza Strip while shooting at Palestinian farmers who attempt to reach their lands in what Israel has declared as a buffer zone.
Meanwhile, farmers east of al-Zaytoun and al-Shajayeh neighborhoods of Gaza City said the Israelis opened basins collecting rainwater flooding as a result over 500 dunums of their lands.
They said serious damage was caused to their crops after their lands were flooded.
Palestinians complained that Israel every year opens the basins during winter to empty them and allows the water to flood and destroy Palestinian land in the Gaza Strip.

"Israel's confiscation of tents, bad weather, pandemic compounded vulnerability of Humsa al-Bqaia community - UN""",2/17/21 18:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123329,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, February 17, 2021 (WAFA) - Yesterday, the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA), an arm of the military government, confiscated five donor-funded livelihood tents assembled to provide shelter to the Bedouin community of Humsa al-Bqaia, in the northern Jordan Valley, and their livestock. This, along with bad weather and the corona pandemic, has compounded the Palestinian community's vulnerability, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Over the first weeks of February, the community has had 62 structures demolished in three incidents, leaving 60 people, including 35 children, displaced and placing them now at imminent risk of forcible transfer.
The community’s vulnerability is compounded by expected severe winter conditions and by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, said OCHA in an update report on the afflicted Palestinian community.
Humsa al-Bqaia’s main needs are for protection, adequate shelter and shelter for their livestock, it said. Due to the heavy military presence and fear of further confiscation/ interception of aid, other partners have also chosen to deliver assistance in nearby communities, which Humsa al-Bqaia community members can access.
In the occupied territories, and since the start of 2021, the Israeli authorities have demolished, seized or forced people to demolish at least 197 Palestinian- owned structures, including 77 donor-funded, displacing over 280 people, including some 150 children. This represents an over 200 percent increase in structures targeted, and an over 500 percent increase in donor-funded structures targeted, compared to the equivalent period in 2020, said OCHA.
The UN organization said that its humanitarian field team is continuing to assess the needs of the community. However, it added, to prevent further confiscations and place the community at greater risk, the support of the broader international community is critical to ensure the Israeli authorities guarantee humanitarian access to provide assistance to people in need.

"Rights group sends urgent appeal to UN Special Procedures on intensified Yitzhar settler violence""",2/17/21 16:51,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123328,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, February 17, 2021 (WAFA) – The Ramallah-based Palestinian human rights organization, Al-Haq, today submitted an urgent appeal to the United Nations (UN) Special Procedures on intensified violence by Israeli settlers from the illegal Yitzhar settlement in the north of the West Bank against Palestinians and their properties.
Addressing five UN Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, Professor Michael Lynk, the urgent appeal presented more than 10 selected Yitzhar settler violence attacks, ""exemplifying Israel’s institutionalized and systematic impunity, and showcasing not only how the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) illegally stand by passively as Palestinians are attacked by Israeli settlers, but also how the IOF further resort to using force against the targeted Palestinians,"" according to an Al-Haq press release.
Settler attacks against the protected Palestinian population and their properties in the occupied West Bank are a widespread, long-term, and worsening phenomenon, said Al-Haq. Such attacks are reinforced by Israel’s systematic failure to conduct effective investigations and prosecutions of offending settlers, creating a climate of impunity.
Highlighting this failure, the United Nations International Fact-Finding Mission on Settlements concluded in its 2013 report that ""there is institutionalized discrimination against the Palestinian people when it comes to addressing violence."" Established on lands belonging to six Palestinian villages in Nablus Governorate: ‘Asira al-Qibliyya, Huwwara, Bourin, Madama, ‘Einabus, and ‘Ourif in 1983, Yitzhar settlement continued to expand on lands belonging to farmers from the six villages, with at least eight settlements built in part on privately-owned Palestinian land.
Illegally transferred-in settlers from the Yitzhar settlement are notorious for their frequent violent attacks, and acts of harassment and intimidation against Palestinians, including by the targeting of livestock, agricultural lands and trees, homes, cars, and properties belonging to Palestinians residing in the surrounding villages, said Al-Haq.
Such attacks include beatings, throwing stones, shooting at villagers with live ammunition, torching agricultural lands, trees, and cars, uprooting trees, confiscating and pillaging natural resources, including land and water, attacking and suppressing peaceful assemblies, denying access to property and to sources of livelihood, and spray-painting hate speech on cars, walls, and other Palestinian properties.
Most of these attacks happen under the watchful eye of the IOF, if not actively encouraged by them. The security guard of the Yitzhar settlement, Isaac Levy known as ‘Yaqoub’, is particularly infamous for his role in organizing frequent attacks on the six villages and for giving orders to the IOF during the attacks.
In the urgent appeal, Al-Haq requested the immediate intervention of the UN Special Procedures to protect the Palestinian population from systematic and ongoing settler attacks, which are conducted with institutionalized impunity, and, in particular to: 

Demand Israel, the Occupying Power, to immediately halt the planning, construction and expansion of its unlawful settlement enterprise and progressively undertake measures to dismantle all existing settlements and their infrastructure and withdraw Israeli settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT);
Call on Israel to guarantee the protection of the Palestinian civilian population in the OPT by taking all necessary measures to ensure effective law enforcement against Israeli settler perpetrators and investigation into incidents of settler violence;
Call on Israel to afford all victims of settler violence access to justice and effective remedies, including by ensuring the investigation of incidents, the prosecution of potential perpetrators, and reparations for its wrongful inaction;
Call on Israel to cease all policies and practices that form part of its apartheid regime against the Palestinian people, particularly with regards to law enforcement and access to justice;
Call on Third States to comply with their obligations to respect and ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions, by immediately adopting effective measures to pressure Israel to abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law;
Call on Third States to take immediate actions and measures against Israel’s settlement enterprise, including by instituting a ban on settlement imports, supporting and endorsing available mechanisms to counter the expansion of Israel’s unlawful settlement enterprise, including the UN Database of all business enterprises involved in or with settlements, and undertaking necessary measures that guarantee Israel’s genuine law enforcement and investigation into incidents of settler violence;
Urge UN Member States to take concrete measures to further the implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations International Fact-Finding Mission on Settlements and previous reports and resolutions;
Urge the European Union, specifically, to adopt restrictive measure on the import of products, goods, and services originating from illegal Israeli settlements in the OPT, namely by supporting  the proposal for a wide ban of trade with and support for illegal settlements;
Publicly call for international justice and accountability for Israel’s widespread, long-established, and systematic human rights violations committed against the Palestinian people, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, including by publicly supporting the recent decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC (International Criminal Court), urging the Prosecutor to immediately begin, without any further delay, a full, thorough, and comprehensive ICC investigation into the Situation in the State of Palestine; and
Urge Third States and the international community to fully cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor as per the obligations set forth in Article 86 of the Rome Statue, and in line with Common Article 1 of the four Geneva Conventions and Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to ensure the arrest and transfer to the Hague of persons investigated and accused of international crimes in the OPT, to prevent the further continuation of international crimes against the Palestinian people.

"Palestinian prisoner in Israeli custody contracts coronavirus """,2/17/21 11:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123322,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, February 17, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian prisoner in Israeli custody has contracted the novel coronavirus, the Prisoners’ Affairs Commission said on Wednesday.
It announced in a statement that Wafa Shalabi, who was detained several days ago in a raid in Ramallah city, underwent a Covid-19 test in the notorious Israeli detention and interrogation facility of Asqalan, and his test result was positive.
It added that an Israeli military court extended on Tuesday the detention of Shalabi for 11 days, citing the need to complete investigation as a pretext. 
This brings the total number of prisoners infected with the virus in all Israeli detention facilities to 362.
Israel’s widely condemned practice of administrative detention that allows the detention of Palestinians without charge or trial for renewable intervals ranging between three and six months based on undisclosed evidence that even a detainee’s lawyer is barred from viewing. 
The US State Department has said in past reports on human rights conditions for Palestinians that administrative detainees are not given the “opportunity to refute allegations or address the evidentiary material presented against them in court.”
Amnesty International has described Israel’s use of administrative detention as a “bankrupt tactic” and has long called on Israel to bring its use to an end.
Palestinian detainees have continuously resorted to open-ended hunger strikes as a way to protest their illegal administrative detention and to demand an end to this policy, which violates international law.

"Woman dies of heart attack in Israeli raid of her house near Bethlehem""",2/17/21 10:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123321,"
BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, February 17, 2021 (WAFA) – A 67-year-old woman died of a heart attack following an Israeli military raid into her house in Abu Njeim village, east of Bethlehem city, according to security and local sources.
They confirmed that Rahmeh Abu ‘Ahour had a fatal heart attack following an Israeli military violent raid into her brother’s house.
The soldiers broke into and ransacked the house, turning it upside down and seized Palestine flags and banners, spreading panic and fear among the family members and causing Abu ‘Ahour to lose consciousness.
She was rushed to a hospital in Beit Jala city, west of Bethlehem, where she died of a heart attack.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

"Israeli army infiltrates Gaza’s frontier, razes farmlands""",2/17/21 09:41,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123320,"
GAZA, Wednesday, February 17, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli army Wednesday morning infiltrated Gaza’s eastern frontier, east of Khan Younes city, and razed farmlands, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that four Israeli military tanks and three bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of Khan Younes city in the southern besieged enclave, leveled large tracts of farmland and erected earth mounds in the area as they fired smoke bombs to camouflage the incursion.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israeli forces raid Palestinian-owned land in east Jerusalem area, remove barbed-wire fence""",2/16/21 16:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123312,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, February 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces stormed a Palestinian-owned land in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukaber and removed the barbed wire fence surrounding it, according to local sources.
Sources said Israeli forces, accompanied by bulldozers, raided an area in Jabal al-Mukaber neighborhood and removed the barbed-wire fence surrounding it. The land belongs to Talab family.
Palestinian residents in Jabal al Mukaber neighborhood are often subjected to harassment from the Israeli police, who regularly raid the neighborhood and hand demolition and stop-construction notices against Palestinian residents’ homes and structures, with the aim of forcing them to leave the area.
East Jerusalem’s 300,000 Palestinians are discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment, and services, and are also considered residents that could be stripped of their right to live in the city at any time and for any reason.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli courts could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Israeli authorities demolishes residential sheds in Jerusalem""",2/16/21 13:47,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123310,"
JERUSALEM,  Tuesday, February 16, 2021 (WAFA) –The Israeli occupation authorities today demolished several residential sheds sheltering Palestinian families in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, according to local sources. 
They told WAFA that Israeli police escorted bulldozers into Ras Kabseh area in the neighborhood, where the heavy machineries tore down the sheds belonging to a member of the Abu Rumoz family, displacing his entire family.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jewish settlers with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish population in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory, have been subject to Israeli occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.

RAMALLAH, Tuesday, February 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today attacked Palestinian vehicles near the village of Turmus Ayya, northeast of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, according to witnesses.
They told WAFA that a number of settlers hurled stones at vehicles with Palestinian registration plates near the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Shilo, breaking their windshields, and punctured their tires.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

He said that four Israeli tanks and three bulldozers entered several dozens of meters into Gaza’s eastern frontier, east of Gaza city, leveled large tracts of farmland, erected earth mounds in the area as they intermittently opened gunfire.
Israel does not allow Palestinians to farm their lands located near the borders and often opens fire at farmers in the area while it destroys the land in the regular brief incursions.
Gaza has been subjected to a crippling Israeli blockade since 2006.

"Israel’s District Court upholds eviction of four Palestinian families in Jerusalem in favor of settlers""",2/16/21 09:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123303,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, February 16, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli District Court in Jerusalem last night rejected an appeal by four Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem against their eviction from their homes for the benefit of Jewish settlers and upheld the eviction order, reported Wadi Hilweh Information Center.
The court gave the four families until May 2 to implement the eviction decision.
Wadi Hilweh quoted the families’ lawyer, Sami Irsheid, saying the District Court upheld the October ruling of the Magistrates Court in favor of evicting Skafi, Kurd, Jaouni, and Qassem families from their homes following a lawsuit filed by Israeli settlers claiming that the land where the houses are located was owned by Jews prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that ended in Israel occupying most of Palestine and displacing three-quarters of its citizens who became refugees until today.
Irsheid said settler organizations, which claimed ownership of the land where the homes are located in what is known as the Karm al-Jaouni area in Sheikh Jarrah, have registered it in the Israeli lands department as their own.
The District Court refused to allow discussion of ownership of the land despite attempts by the lawyers to prove that the settlers do not own the land on which the housing project was built in 1956 by the Jordanian government and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) for the Palestinians displaced following the Israeli occupation in 1948.
The families plan to appeal their case to the Israeli High Court.
More than 80 British parliamentarians representing all parties, in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, recently wrote in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, that the British government must do everything in its power to prevent the mass/forced evictions and dispossession of Palestinian families in occupied East Jerusalem, making a case for the Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.

RAMALLAH, Monday, February 15, 2021 (WAFA) – The Minister of Health, Mai Alkaila, said today that the Israeli occupation authorities banned the entry of coronavirus vaccines into the besieged Gaza Strip.
In a statement, the health minister held the Israeli occupation authorities responsible for this arbitrary procedure, which she stressed is contrary to all customs, laws, and international agreements.
She noted that the ministry sent 2,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik-V vaccine to the Gaza Strip, but the occupation refused to let the vaccines into the coastal enclave.
Alkaila pointed out that these doses were intended for medical staff working in the intensive care units designated for Covid-19 patients, and the teams working in emergency departments.
The minister stressed that the government and the Health Ministry are communicating with international organizations to pressure Israel to allow the entry of vaccines as quickly as possible into the Strip.

"Israeli settlers attack palestinian family south of Nablus""",2/15/21 18:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123300,"
NABLUS, Monday, February 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers attacked today evening a Palestinian family in the village of Iraq Burin to the south of Nablus, injuring a mother and her two children, according to local sources.
Sources told WAFA Israeli settlers attacked local resident Yasser Omran and his wife and three children, while they were present in their land to the east of the village of Iraq Burin.
Settlers used rubber-coated steel bullets, stones, and stun grenades against the family, injuring the wife and her two children.
They also uprooted and stole the family’s olive saplings.
Settler violence has long since become part of Palestinians’ daily life under occupation. Israeli security forces enable these actions, which result in Palestinians casualties – injuries and fatalities – as well as damage to land and property, said the Israeli information center for human rights in the occupied territories, B’Tselem.
In some cases, they even serve as an armed escort, or even join in the attacks, said the center.
“Investigations, if even opened, are usually closed with no action taken against perpetrators as part of an undeclared policy of leniency. The long-term effect of this violence is the dispossession of Palestinians from increasing parts of the West Bank, making it easier for Israel to take over land and resources,” said B’Tselem.

JERUSALEM, Monday, February 15, 2021 (WAFA) - The Israeli West Jerusalem municipality today forced two families to self-demolish their houses and a third family a structure under the pretext that they were built without a permit, according to a Palestinian group.
The East Jerusalem-based Wadi Hilweh Information Center said that the Israeli municipality issued demolition notices against structures, including houses, owned by three Palestinian families in Jerusalem, forcing them to carry out the demolition themselves to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the municipality demolishes them.
Jihad Awadallah, one of the owners of the structures, said that his family demolished its two-story building in Shufat neighborhood, which was built 20 years ago.
He pointed out that his family tried all these years to obtain a permit without success and that it has paid over $35,000 in fines.
Awadallah indicated that each apartment in the building was 120 square meters and that his brother used to live in one of them, but he was forced to move to a rented apartment after the demolition.
Meanwhile, the Israeli municipality forced Nimr Nimr to demolish an apartment owned by his son in Sur Baher, southeast of Jerusalem.
Nimr explained that the apartment, which was 90 square meters, was built five years ago, and that the necessary finishes were underway on the apartment when the Israeli municipality issued a demolition notice against it and informed him that he should immediately demolish it or otherwise its staff will do so.
The Israeli municipality also forced Omar Siam to demolish an animal shed in Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem under the pretext that it was built without a permit.
Palestinians in Jerusalem say they are forced to build without a permit because getting a building permit is impossible as the right-wing mayor and city council attempt to keep the city's Palestinian population at a bare minimum while multiplying its settler community by approving the construction of thousands of new housing units in Jewish-only settlements.
Almost 75 percent of applications for a permit by the Palestinian citizens of Jerusalem are rejected by the municipality, according to rights groups.

"Ministry of Telecommunications denounces Israeli plans to expand cellular coverage in occupied lands""",2/15/21 11:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123293,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, February 15, 2021 (WAFA) – The Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology today denounced Israel government decision that would allow Israeli cellular companies to expand their 4G coverage in the West Bank to reach 95%, ignoring international laws and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.
Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology, Ishaq Sider, said in a statement that the ministry is closely following this matter with the relevant authorities, including the International Telecommunication Union and the International Quartet’s office, and it will go to international courts to put an end to this blatant transgression, through which the Israelis aim to destroy the Palestinian economy and the Palestinian telecommunications companies that would prevent the development of the Palestinian technological sector.
""While the Palestinians are still deprived until today of the 4G and 5G services, the Israeli government continues to impose a fait accompli on the ground and the cyberspace, which we consider a violation and theft of the Palestinian people’s resources,"" he said, explaining that this grave step is not the first by Israel and that it is part of an Israeli policy that aims at dominating the Palestinian airwaves and resources that are necessary for operating modern communication technology services.
The Ministry called on all relevant international bodies to act immediately to put a stop to this Israeli transgression.
Palestine Telecommunications (Paltel) Group CEO, Ammar Aker, said the Israeli decision to expand the coverage of Israeli 4G networks in the Palestinian territories is tantamount to an invasion of the Palestinian market by those companies and an attempt to legitimize the Israeli settlements by treating them as part of the Israeli state.
Aker added that the Israeli occupation policy is to sustain the occupation of all that is Palestinian, and the airwaves are no exception to this policy, particularly since the Israeli occupation government continues to deny the Palestinian companies the right to use the 4G and 5G services, depriving as a result Palestinian subscribers from benefiting from the same services offered by the Israeli companies, which harms the competitiveness of the Palestinian companies.
He called on the international community to put a stop to such policies by forcing Israel to abide by international law and the laws governing the work of the telecommunications sector while refraining from imposing a fait accompli by force.
Ooredoo-Palestine Telecommunications Company CEO, Dergham Mari, said that this step gives a competitive advantage to the Israeli companies and inflicts great damage on the Palestinian telecommunications sector, considered one of the pillars of the Palestinian economy, which is already suffering from a ban on using the latest technological systems, especially the 4G and 5G networks, and the scarcity of frequencies granted to Palestinian companies.

GAZA, Monday, February 15, 2021 (WAFA) - A number of Israeli military vehicles today breached the borders with the Gaza Strip and infiltrated dozens of meters into the east of the town of Jabalya, north of the Gaza Strip, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that three bulldozers and three tanks breached the borders and trampled on agricultural land and farms dozens of meters inside the borders, destroying land and building dirt mounds while shooting in the air and firing smoke canisters to obscure the raid.
He noted that Israeli army drones could be seen flying in the eastern parts of the town as well as the Gaza city.
Israeli forces occasionally raid and destroy agricultural lands on the borders in the north and east of the Gaza Strip.

"Israeli forces notify for demolition of houses south of Nablus""",2/14/21 16:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123287,"
NABLUS, Sunday, February 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel today notified Palestinians in the town of Yatma, south of Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank, of its intention to demolish their homes, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA Israeli forces handed 15 Palestinian residents demolition notices against their houses, under the pretext they were built without a permit.
Israel uses many pretexts to justify its demolition policy, including the pretext of building having been constructed without a building permit. However, as the Occupying Power, Israel is prohibited from demolishing the property of the protected Palestinian people unless strictly justified by military necessity. The extensive destruction of property carried out by Israel without military necessity constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may constitute a war crime, said the human rights organization, Al-Haq.
Moreover, this policy of unlawfully demolishing Palestinian buildings and structures, taken alongside many other similarly unlawful policies and actions, reveal Israel’s intention to forcibly transfer Palestinian communities from their homes, it said. 
“Having their properties demolished and destroyed, the Palestinian people are deprived of their right to develop their resources and are ultimately denied from exercising their right to self-determination,” added the center.

"Despite lifting of lockdown, Israel bans reopening of shops in Jerusalem's old city""",2/14/21 14:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123286,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, February 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Despite Israel's lifting of its third nationwide lockdown last week, Israeli occupation forces continue to bar some Palestinian shop owners in the old city of Jerusalem from reopening their shops to customers, according to Hijazi Rishiq, chairman of the Jerusalem Merchants Committee.
Rishiq told WAFA that Israeli police have since been patrolling the markets of the old city of Jerusalem more than usual, in an attempt to foil any initiatives aimed at boosting the economic life of the old city and helping merchants recover from the state of recession caused by the lockdown. 
He said only a slight improvement was witnessed in the commercial activity in Jerusalem's old city following the reopening of the economy, embattled by the 42-day lockdown which was imposed in early January following a surge in coronavirus infections in Israel.
Hijzai pointed out that Israeli occupation authorities are taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to stifle the Palestinian economy in Jerusalem, under the pretext that Palestinian-owned commercial stores were attracting more customers than in other areas, despite the lifting of lockdown.
Last week, Israeli police forced some shop owners to close their shops and threatened some of them with a fine of 10,000 shekels (approximately $3000) in the event that they reopened, despite the lifting of the lockdown.
He slammed such pretexts as flimsy excuses used by the Israeli authorities to strangle the Palestinian economy in the city.

GAZA, Sunday, February 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces stationed on the border with the Gaza Strip today opened fire at Palestinian farmers working in their lands near the border, forcing them to leave the area, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that the occupation soldiers, stationed at the military watchtowers overlooking the border area east of Gaza City, fired several rounds of live bullets and teargas at the farmers, forcing them to leave the area to avoid being shot.
No injuries were reported.
Israel does not allow Palestinians to reach their lands along the Gaza border with Israel and often infiltrate the borders to either destroy the land and level it or to build dirt mounds causing serious damage to fertile agricultural land.
The Israeli occupation army regularly open fire at people near the border fence with Gaza, including farmers attending to their land, in order to keep them as far from the border as possible.

"Palestinian family forced to demolish own structures in Jerusalem""",2/14/21 10:16,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123281,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, February 14, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian family from the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan embarked today on demolishing animal barns of its own after it was forced to do so by Israeli municipality to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the municipality carries out the demolition.
Omar Seyam, a Palestinian citizen of Silwan, told Wadi Hilweh Information Center that he was forced to demolish the barns, which he uses for raising livestock, after the Israeli municipality issued a demolition order against them under the pretext they were built without a permit. 
Seyam said he had no choice but to do so in order to avoid paying unreasonable demolition costs to the Israeli municipality.
Palestinians in Jerusalem say they are forced to build without a permit because getting a building permit is impossible as the right-wing mayor and city council attempt to keep the city's Palestinian population at a bare minimum while multiplying its settler community by approving the construction of thousands of new housing units in Jewish-only settlements.
Almost 75 percent of applications for a permit by the Palestinian citizens of Jerusalem are rejected by the municipality, according to rights groups.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, February 14, 2021 (WAFA) - Hundreds of Israeli protesters gathered for the 34th week last night outside the official residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in occupied Jerusalem, demanding his resignation.
Another main demonstration was also held outside Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal city of Caesaria. Smaller protests took place at highway overpasses and junctions around the country. Several hundred demonstrators gathered in each of the locations in Paris Square in occupied Jerusalem and in Caesaria.
Other smaller protests saw Israeli protesters demonstrating against Netanyahu at intersections and overpasses.
Near Kiryat Ono outside Tel Aviv, Israeli media said a woman threatened demonstrators with a plastic gun. The woman fled in a vehicle which was later stopped and arrested by police.
In Rishon Letzion, protestors reported a man assaulted them and tore down signs.
The Black Flags protest group, who has led the demonstrations, said that rocks were thrown toward demonstrators in Netanya, as well as at a vehicle near the town of Daburiyya, causing property damage.
The protesters have been gathering each week for over seven months, saying Netanyahu should step down because of his corruption trial and what they say is mismanagement of the country’s coronavirus crisis.
The protesters say Netanyahu cannot serve as prime minister when he is on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. His trial is set to resume this week.

"Villagers fend off extremist settlers attacking two villages near Nablus""",2/13/21 17:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123275,"
NABLUS, Saturday, February 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Residents of the villages of Qusra and Asira al-Qibliya, in the occupied West Bank district of Nablus, today fended off an attack by dozens of hardcore Israeli settlers targeting the outskirts of the two villages, according to local sources.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official in charge of monitoring settler attacks in the area, told WAFA that dozens of settlers from the illegal colonial settlement of Yitzhar, illegally built on Palestinian land nearby, attacked the facilities in the outskirts of the two village with a cover from the Israeli occupation army and the Israeli Border Police.
Residents of the two villages gathered in large numbers to confront the attack, and loudspeakers of mosques were reportedly heard calling on villagers to be on alert in the face of the attack. 
Israeli occupation army, which provided a cover for the attacking settlers, fired teargas canisters at the protesting Palestinian residents causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation, as the settlers failed to continue their way inside the two villages and rather returned to the illegal settlement.
Attacks by hardcore Israeli settlers against defenseless Palestinian communities have been on the rise since last December, with Israeli occupation army providing protection for them in most of the registered cases.

HEBRON, Saturday, February 13, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation forces today forced a Palestinian resident of Khirbet al-Thaala hamlet in Masafer Yatta in the south of the West Bank to remove a tent he had set up to shelter his family of 13 people, according to a local activist.
Rateb al-Jabour, from the national and popular committee in the south of Hebron, told WAFA that soldiers raided the hamlet and forced the resident to remove the tent where he and his family of 13 people live, forcing them to live in the open.
He said the army and the area’s illegal settlers do not want to see any Palestinians in that land in order to take it over for their settlement activity, particularly the expansion of the illegal Maon and Carmiel settlements.
Jabour said residents of the hamlet have papers proving ownership of the land, but that the occupying power does not take them into regard and persists in efforts to appropriate their lands and to displace them.

JERUSALEM, Saturday, February 13, 2021 (WAFA) – A group of Israeli Jewish fanatics today trespassed and desecrated a Muslim cemetery located just below Jerusalem’s old city wall, according to a Palestinian official.
Munther Siam, member of the committee in charge of Muslim cemeteries in Jerusalem, told WAFA that the Israelis first walked through the Muslim cemetery known as Bab al-Rahma cemetery, under police protection, before reaching Lions’ Gate, one of the gates to the old city located near the cemetery, where they performed Jewish rituals.
Ahmad Sumrein, spokesman for the committee, told WAFA that residents of Silwan, a neighborhood of East Jerusalem where the cemetery is located and where the neighborhood’s dead are buried, confronted the Israeli fanatics and forced them to leave the cemetery.
This is not the first time Jewish fanatics trespass on the cemetery and they previously held a party there, he said.
The cemetery is located below the close Bab al-Rahma gate that leads to the walled-in Al-Haram Al-Sharif compound, the third holiest site in Islam that houses Al-Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock, as well as other Muslim mosques and antiquities buildings.

"Palestinian man seriously injured by settlers south of Nablus""",2/12/21 18:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123262,"
NABLUS, Friday, February 12, 2021 (WAFA) - A Palestinian man was seriously injured on Friday evening after he was assaulted and beaten up by colonial Israeli settlers and occupation soldiers in the village of Kafr Qallil, south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to witnesses.
Hayel Amer, a local Palestinian citizen from Kafr Qallil, said Israeli settlers who were accompanied by a military escort assaulted and beat up his brother, Nassir, causing him serious wounds and fractures across his body.
Amer said his brother was rushed to nearby Rafidia Public Hospital in Nablus for medical treatment, where he was expected to undergo multiple badly-needed surgeries.
Earlier today, two Palestinian women were assaulted and injured by hardcore settlers near the abandoned Israeli settlement of Homesh, north of Nablus.

JENIN, Friday, February 12, 2021 (WAFA) - Hardcore Israeli settlers today assaulted, beat up and injured two Palestinian women outside the abandoned Israeli settlement of Homesh, south of Jenin in the north of the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official in charge of monitoring settlement activities in the area, told WAFA that a group of settlers who were making a provocative visit to the abandoned settlement of Homesh surprised the two women, attacked them with stones and beat them up, causing them moderate bruises.
The two women are residents of the nearby village of Fandaqumiya.
Violence and vandalism by Israeli settlers is commonplace in the occupied West Bank, and is never prosecuted by the occupation authorities.
Attacks by settlers against Palestinians particularly intensified during the last few months, with Israeli occupation army turning a blind eye to the violence spree and providing the settlers with protection.

RAMALLAH, Friday, February 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians were injured from military gunfire as Israeli forces today afternoon suppressed an anti-settlement rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city. 
Member of the Popular Committee for Land Defense, Salim Abu Jaish, said that a large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend Palestinian-owned land threatened with confiscation, east of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction.
Soldiers opened fire toward the participants, hitting one with a live round and another with a rubber-coated steel bullet in their feet. Both casualties were rushed to a hospital for treatment.
Dozens of participants were treated on the scene from the effects of tear gas suffocation. 
Beit Dajan has become a scene for weekly protests against the Israeli authorities move to construct new colonial settlements and expand existing ones at the expense of Palestinian territory.
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

SALFIT, Friday, February 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today assaulted an anti-land-grab rally to the west of Bidyya town, west of Salfit city, according to local sources.
They confirmed that a group of settlers attacked Palestinians taking part in a rally in Khallet Hassan, located on the outskirts of the village which has been facing an imminent threat of confiscation for the benefit of the colonial Israeli settlement project.
Israeli soldiers intervened to provide protection to the assailants, who briefly held a participant who was documenting the settler attack.
The Israeli occupation authorities plan to seize thousands of donums of land belonging to five villages located to the west of Salfit and south of Qalqilia to make room for the construction of a new colonial settlement.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops suppressed a rally that was called for to defend Palestinian land in al-Marhat and al-Ras area, west of Salfit city, against confiscation.
The soldiers opened fire towards the rally participants, directly hitting one with a tear gas canister in the head and causing dozens others to suffocate from tear gas.
The casualty was rushed to a hospital in the city for urgent treatment.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights following the 1967 war, and has since built hundreds of illegal Jewish-only settlements throughout the occupied territories.
Israel’s nation-state law states that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

Tahseen Hamed, a local activist, said that a group of settlers forced their way into a plot of land belonging to the Hamed family, and expelled the farmers who were planting olive saplings at gunpoint.
The plot of land is located west of the Israeli colonial settlement of Avni Hevetz, which was constructed on lands seized from Shufa village.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

RAMALLAH, Friday, February 12, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today forced a Palestinian to demolish his own livestock barn in al-Fureidis village, east of Bethlehem city, according to an official.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem Hassan Breija said that Sleiman al-Wahsh tore down his barn, which occupied 60 square meters, to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Israeli military bulldozers carry out the demolition. 
Al-Wahsh carried out the demolition of his barn four days after receiving a demolition order purportedly for building it without a license.
He pointed that he was rearing 50 sheep in the barn, which was the main source of livelihood for his family, comprising 14 members.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

JENIN, Thursday, February 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Governor of Jenin, Akram Rjoub, today inspected the Kabaha family house demolished yesterday by the Israeli army and described the act as another Israeli crime against the Palestinian people while pledging to help the stricken family recover from this calamity.
After inspecting the site and the damage done to four nearby houses after blowing up the Kabaha house, Rjoub strongly condemned the collective Israeli punishment policy against the Palestinian people in general and the Kabaha family in particular that left the mother and her four children homeless.
""This is another crime by the Israeli occupation against our people,"" said Rjoub. ""It will not break our determination and will."" The Governor said President Mahmoud Abbas gave instruction to provide the family with whatever assistance it needs to help it recover and live a decent life, including providing it with a place to live.

"Israel to demolish Palestinian-owned structures in a northern West Bank village""",2/11/21 10:51,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123236,"
NABLUS, Thursday, February 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel today notified Palestinians in Ein Shibli village, east of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, of its intention to demolish several of their structures under the pretext they were built without a permit, according to a local official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors the Israeli colonial settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that soldiers broke into Ein Shibli village and handed two residents demolition notices against one house, a shed and a water tank they owned, and another resident a demolition notice against two residential structures and livestock shed he owned.
Another resident was ordered to remove a caravan he had placed in the village.
Israel denies permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to expand existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
On the other hand, Israel builds thousands of housing units for Israelis only in illegal settlements spread throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

BETHLEHEM, Thursday, February 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Concern was high today in the southern West Bank village of Kisan, east of Bethlehem, when Israelis started surveying lands east of the village, according to the head of the village council Ahmad Ghazal.
He told WAFA that a crew of Israeli surveyors inspected the land estimated at 500 dunums and located near the illegal settlement of Abie Hanahal in order to take it over and build a new settlement outpost on it.
He said the targeted area is considered the only pastures used by the shepherds and livestock farmers in Kisan and therefore taking it over will hurt them drastically.
Israelis from the antiquities authority came to the same land three days ago and carried out excavation, which raised serious concern that the takeover of the land is imminent.

"Israeli forces blow up house of Palestinian allegedly accused of killing an Israeli settler """,2/10/21 21:41,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123232,"
JENIN, Wednesday, February 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today evening blew up the family house of Palestinian prisoner in Israeli jails, Mohammed Murweh Kabaha, who was allegedly accused by the Israeli occupation of killing an Israeli settler in late December 2020.
Israeli forces earlier today raided the village of Tura, southwest of Jenin, and declared it a closed military zone, before proceeding to plant explosives and demolish the exterior walls of Kabaha’s two-story family home, which houses his wife and four children. 
Forces reportedly attacked residents and prevented them from leaving or entering the village, leading to clashes. An elderly woman suffocated during the clashes which necessitated her transfer to the hospital for medical treatment.
Israel resorts to punitively demolish the family homes of Palestinians- as a means of deterrence- accused of being involved in attacks against Israelis, a policy that Israel does not apply to Israeli settlers who were involved in fatal attacks against Palestinians.
The policy was widely condemned by human rights groups as “a collective punishment” and “a war crime and crime against humanity”.

"Hebron’s Palestinian mayor receives death threats from settlers""",2/10/21 15:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123227,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, February 10, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian mayor of Hebron, Taysir Abu Senineh, today received death threats from Israeli settlers.
Abu Sneineh received death threats from mayor of the Israeli colonial settlement of Kiryat Arba Eliyahu Liebman and member of the Israeli parliament Moshe Abutbul.
He described the settler threats to kill him as part of a campaign of incitement aimed at consolidating the Israeli occupation’s racism and quest to colonize Hebron and its old city, as he pointed that this was not the first time for him to receive such deaths threats from Israeli settlers.
Commenting on the reasons behind incitement against him, Abu Sneineh noted that it is because of his firm rejection of the Israeli occupation authorities’ decision to build an elevator to facilitate settlers’ access to the ancient Ibrahimi Mosque in violation of international law and alter the Palestinian identity of the site.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ministry denounced “in the strongest possible terms” the settler threats to kill Abu Sneineh and considered them as part of the Israeli settler-colonialist project targeting Hebron city in general, and the Ibrahimi Mosque in particular.  
It held the Israeli government fully and directly responsible for any harm against Abu Sneineh and the Islamic Waqf staff in the city.
In May 2020, the Israeli military issued an expropriation order allowing construction to begin on an elevator project that would make a portion of the ancient Ibrahimi Mosque wheelchair accessible. 
Palestinians have denounced the elevator project as a “dubious way for the Israeli government and settlers to steal more of Palestinian land” and “swallow up more space of the already restricted Muslim side of the compound”.
Twenty six years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada Street.
An estimated 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers live under the protection of thousands of soldiers in Hebron’s city center. The city is home to over 30,000 Palestinians.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.

They said that Israeli soldiers opened fire toward Ahmad Barham near the town as he was heading to his workplace inside Israel, hitting him with a live round in the foot.
Barham was rushed to a hospital for treatment.
Hundreds of Palestinians work in Israel without a permit and often police chase them and detain them before sending them back to the occupied West Bank where work is more scarce than in Israel and pay is much less.
A large number of Palestinians, especially construction workers, pass the checkpoint every day, facing extreme overcrowding and often waiting for hours in line due inspection procedures as every person must pass through metal turnstiles one-at-a-time.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.

"Israeli forces demolish water collection pond near Jericho""",2/10/21 12:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123216,"
JERICHO, Wednesday, February 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday demolished a water collection pond in the village of Marj Na‘ja, to the north of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to local sources.
Head of the Marj Na‘ja Village Council, Kayed Masoud, told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to the north of the village, where the heavy machinery demolished a pond used to collect water for the irrigation of a nearby palm farm belonging to Saleh Abu Hashem.
He pointed that the pond had the capacity of some 1,400 cubic meters and used to supply water for the irrigation of scores of donums planted with palm trees, benefiting some 20 families.
He denounced the demolition as part of Israel’s systematic policy designed to tighten restrictions on Palestinian farmers and sabotage their sources of livelihood in the Jordan Valley. 
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

HEBRON, Wednesday, February 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today seized tore down a tent and seized two others in Masafer Yatta and to the east of Yatta village, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local sources said.
Foad al-Amour, a local activist, said that Israeli forces tore down a residential tent belonging to Haroun Abu ‘Iram in Khirbet al-Rakiz, one of the 19 hamlets which make up the Masafer Yatta area.
The soldiers also seized two others tents; one used as a resting station for hikers near an Israeli military station in the village of Susia, and another one used as a health unit, east of Yatta.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.

"Israeli forces detain 30 Palestinians from West Bank""",2/10/21 11:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123214,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, February 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday carried out large-scale detention raids across the West Bank, detaining 30 Palestinians, according to local and security sources.
The sources confirmed that Israeli forces rounded up five Palestinians after ransacking their families’ houses in Ein Yabrud town, northeast of Ramallah city.
The soldiers also detained two others after storming and searching their houses in al-Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya town, northeast of the city. 
Israeli military vehicles stormed Beitin village, northeast of the city, where soldiers rounded up six others.
In Jerusalem district, Israeli forces re-arrested a former prisoner in a raid in al-Eizariya town, southeast of Jerusalem.
This came as Israeli police detained another Palestinian after breaking into his house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of al-Issawiya.
In Bethlehem district, Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committee, Ahmad Salah, confirmed an Israeli military raid in al-Khader town, south of the city, resulting in the detention of two former prisoners.
In Hebron district, the sources said that Israeli troops conducted a raid in Sa‘ir town, east of Hebron city, detaining three Palestinians, including a nonviolent activist with the Popular Anti-Wall and Settlement Committees, Khaled Suleiman al-Adra, 50.
The soldiers conducted a similar raid in al-Arroub refugee camp, north of Hebron, resulting in the detention of another.
Meanwhile, Director of the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS) Muntaser Samour said that Israeli forces barged their way into Qabatiya town, south of Jenin, where they detained three Palestinians.
During the ensuing confrontations, the soldiers opened fire toward the local youngsters who attempted to block their passage. No injuries were reported though.
Soldiers forced their way into Kafr Ra‘i town, northwest of Jenin, where they re-arrested a former prisoner. 
In the meantime, Israeli soldiers manning Huwara checkpoint, south of Nablus city, detained three Palestinians after stopping their vehicle at the checkpoint.
The detainees were identified as residents of Balata refugee camp.
Two others were detained in separate raids in the Nablus neighborhoods of al-Quds Street and Ad-Dahyeh. 
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

HEBRON, Tuesday, February 09, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers Today evening uprooted dozens of olive trees in the Masafer Yatta area to the south of Hebron, in the southern occupied West Bank, according to Fouad al-Amour, a local activist.
He told WAFA settlers from the illegal Israeli settlement of Havat Maon uprooted around 50 olive trees belonging to Rabei family in the al-Hamra area, near at-Tiwani village, east of Masafer Yatta.
He added that residents were surprised today evening to find out that settlers have cut off the fence surrounding the land and uprooted around 50 four-year-old olive trees.
To be noted, Israeli settlers have been repeatedly uprooting olive trees in the aforementioned area in recent years, aiming to force farmers out of their lands in order to expand existing settlements and implement new settlement projects.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

"Palestinians rally against looming dispossession of four families in occupied East Jerusalem""",2/9/21 14:12,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123201,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, February 09, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinians today rallied in protest of the looming dispossession of four Palestinian families in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and the transfer of their homes to Israeli settlers.
Scores of Palestinians staged a rally in front of the Israeli District Court in Jerusalem as the court convened to hear an appeal against the forced eviction of 17 Palestinian families from their houses from the neighborhood.
Husni Abu Hussein, an attorney representing the afflicted residents of Sheikh Jarrah, said that the District Court has kept the ruling to evict al-Kurd, Skafi, Jaouni and Qassem families from their houses within a maximum period of three months following a legal battle waged against them by Israeli settler organizations who claim the four houses were owned by Jews prior to 1948 and therefore their current residents, who have been living there for decades, should be evicted.
He added that the court would consider for the first time the deeds obtained from the Land Registry that prove the families’ ownership in the neighborhood.
Abu Hussein warned that three other Palestinian families in the same neighborhood are awaiting similar eviction orders in March.
The families facing the imminent threat of dispossession consider initiating criminal proceedings against Israeli settlers at the International Criminal Court (ICC), encouraged by the court’s ruling that it has jurisdiction over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, occupied in June 1967.
Meanwhile, Coordinator of the Civic Coalition for Human Rights in Jerusalem, Zakaria Odeh, said that Israeli settler-colonialist organizations are using all means to drive the 17 families, comprising 83 members, from their houses in the East Jerusalem neighborhood, which is part of a policy by the Israeli authorities that is being implemented in other East Jerusalem neighborhoods such as Silwan and Isawiyya.
While Israeli courts evict Palestinians from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem under the pretext that the property was once owned by Jews, the courts deny Palestinians who have ownership deeds of homes and lands in West Jerusalem and other parts of what was once called Palestine and today is Israel that were taken over by the Israeli occupying power and handed over to Jewish families after 1948 alleging the homes and lands were taken over during war and therefore their original owners have no right to claim them back.
East Jerusalem’s 300,000 Palestinians are discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are also considered residents that could be stripped of their right to live in the city at any time and for any reason.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli courts could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.
Meanwhile, 81 British parliamentarians representing all parties, in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, wrote in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, that the British government must do everything in its power to prevent the mass/forced evictions and dispossession of Palestinian families in occupied East Jerusalem, making a case for the Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood threatened with eviction in favor of settlers.

JERUSALEM, Monday, February 08, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli police prevented today Palestinian shop owners in the Old City of Jerusalem from opening their shops despite lifting the general lockdown imposed to confront the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
WAFA correspondent said that the Israeli police patrolled the streets in Jerusalem's old city and forced the majority of Arab shops to close.
Hijazi Rishiq, chairman of the East Jerusalem Merchants' Committee, told WAFA Israeli police forced shop owners to close their shops, threatening a fine of NIS10,000 (approximately $3000) for anyone who opens despite the lifting of the lockdown in Jerusalem yesterday, with the clear intention of targeting and crippling the old town's economy.
He indicated that the Israeli authorities lifted the closure in West Jerusalem on Sunday, which lasted from December 27, 2020, until February 7, 2021, while keeping most of the Arab shops in the Old City of Jerusalem closed, except for grocery shops and vegetable markets, under the pretext that such shops receive large numbers of people.

"UN, EU stress need to provide secure, dignified living to southern Hebron hills """,2/8/21 16:12,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123186,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, February 8, 2021 (WAFA) – The United Nations and European Union today stressed the need to provide Palestinian residents and schoolchildren in the southern Hebron hills with secure and dignified living.
Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Sarah Muscroft, and UNICEF Special Representative to Palestine, Lucia Elmi, besides to a host of international diplomats made this call during a visit to Khirbet Umm Qassa of the Bedouin community of Azwadeen and al-Fakhit communities.
The diplomats made their way to the Challenge and Steadfastness School No. 20 the Co-ed Secondary Masafer School, where they listened to first-hand accounts of the harsh conditions experienced by the Palestinian communities due to the Israeli occupation measures aimed at their forceful displacement.
They also called for ensuring that school children have safe and unhindered access to schools in the collection of hamlets that make up the Masafer Yatta area.
Mayor of Yatta, Issa Smeirat and the Assistant Under-Secretary for Education Thrwat Zeid among other officials highlighted the suffering of the Palestinian communities in the southern Hebron hills, including obstructing students’ access to children and the threat of demolishing tents, water wells and structures as part of the plan to ethnically cleanse them to make room for the construction of Israeli colonial settlements.  
They called for following up the case of the Palestinian communities threatened with forceful displacement before international courts as well as for improving the services provided to Masafer Yatta communities, including the construction of schoolrooms and clinics.  
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

NABLUS, Monday, February 08, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers today began illegal construction work on Palestinian-owned lands in the village of Einabus, to the south of the northern occupied West Bank city of Nablus.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activity in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that settlers proceeded to carry on construction work on lands that had razed about a month ago in the village.
He added that these lands belong to Palestinian citizens who own legal documents that prove ownership of the lands.
Daghlas noted that the work intends to expand the illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar, built on six Nablus-district villages and other Palestinian-owned lands.

They said soldiers arrived at the site and started to remove the tents in their efforts to force the Palestinian residents of the community to relocate to another area under the pretext the current location is a military training area, a pretext the army uses to empty the land from its Palestinian residents.
Israeli forces recently demolished or confiscated 46 structures in Humsa al-Bqaia, leaving 60 people, including 35 children, displaced and at risk of forcible transfer. Many of the affected structures were donor-funded and had been provided as a response to previous mass demolitions or confiscations.

Soldiers demolished a well in the village of al-Mughayyer, east of Ramallah, according to the head of the village council Marzouk Abu Naim.
He told WAFA that a large army force raided the northern section of the village and proceeded to demolish the well owned by a local farmer, which he used for irrigating his land.
He said the soldiers demolished a few months ago two wells for the same farmer in the village under the pretext they were built without a permit.
In Tubas in the northern Jordan Valley, soldiers demolished two caravans in Khirbet Yarza hamlet, east of Tubas, that were used as a residence for two brothers, according to Mutaz Bisharat, an official with Tubas Governorate.
He told WAFA that an international humanitarian agency provided a few months ago the caravans to the two brothers to be set up as shelters for them after their homes were demolished by the Israeli military in September under the pretext of being built without a permit.

NABLUS, Sunday, February 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation army ordered today a halt on the construction of seven houses for Palestinian households in the village of Sarra, to the west of Nablus city in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Morad Shtewi, a field director in the Colonization and Settlement Resistance Commission, told WAFA that an Israeli military force raided the village and ordered a halt on all construction works, under the pretext that the houses were being built in an area that overlooks the nearby illegal settlement outpost of Havat Gilad.
The site where the construction is ordered to stop is located in an area classified as Area C, under full Israeli administrative and military control, where Israel rarely issues construction permits to Palestinians, forcing many people to build without permits in order to fulfill their housing demands.
Israel refuses to allow Palestinian development of any kind in Area C, which makes up over 60 percent of the total area of the occupied West Bank, and often demolishes what Palestinians build despite the Israeli ban.

The UN’s principal judicial organ said at that time that construction ""would be tantamount to de facto annexation"" as it explained that the barrier could create a potentially permanent ""fait accompli"" on the ground.

Witnesses told WAFA that a group of settlers sneaked their way into a ranch near the village, where they uprooted 30 olive saplings and stole farming equipment belonging to Mr. Yousef Sabra, a local Palestinian farmer.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities, as the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction over Israeli settlers under signed agreements.

GAZA, Sunday, February 07, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israel occupation's navy today opened fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen as they were sailing off the coast of Khan Younis, south of the Gaza Strip, forcing them to return to shore.
WAFA correspondent said the Israeli navy fired live bullets and water cannons towards fishermen who were sailing approximately six nautical miles away from Khan Younis, forcing them to abandon their fishing trip and return home.
Israeli navy also attacked fishermen while sailing about three nautical miles from the shore of Al-Sudaniya area in Gaza City, forcing them to return to the shore.
No casualties were reported.
Israeli naval forces and their gunboats have long been harassing Gaza fishermen, shooting at them, damaging their boats and making arrests. Sometimes fishermen are injured or killed during gunfire attacks.
In addition to attacking fishermen, Israel regularly bans boats from accessing the water and reducing the fishing zone which Palestinians from Gaza can access.
Israeli naval authorities have been enforcing a naval blockade on Gaza's 40-kilometre-length coast since 2007.

"Occupation forces injure five Palestinians, including a medic, in Kafr Qaddum""",2/6/21 18:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123158,"
QALQILIA, Saturday, February 06, 2021 (WAFA) – At least five Palestinians, including a paramedic, were injured by Israeli occupation forces today as the latter attacked dozens of demonstrators taking part in an anti-settlement protest in the village of Kafr Qaddum, the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Morad Shtewi, coordinator of the popular resistance in the village, told WAFA that soldiers raided the village, clashed with demonstrators and attacked them with rubber-coated rounds and teargas, injuring five Palestinians by rubber-coated rounds, including a paramedic.
The wounded were treated at the scene of the clashes.
The protesters were demonstrating against Israeli settlement construction and expansion as well as daily Israeli violations in the occupied Palestinian territories, especially the Jordan Valley.

"Thousands rally in Tamra against Israeli police complicity in crime wave """,2/6/21 17:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123157,"
NAZARETH, Saturday, February 06, 2021 (WAFA) – Thousands of Palestinian protesters took part in a central rally today in the city of Tamra, north of Israeli-occupied historical Palestine, to express their resentment over Israeli police complicity in the ongoing crime wave and collaboration with outlaws.
The crowds rallied at the Clock Square in the city and marched towards adjacent Route 70 and blocked it to the traffic in both directions for some time. 
Among the protesters were mayors of Arab communities, Arab MPs, members of Arab factions and representatives of the civil society.
Yesterday, thousands of Palestinians took part in smaller rallies at many cities and towns in the occupied land to express their fury over police complicity and collaboration with outlaws, who thus far this year have killed 12 people across Arab-majority communities.
One of the rallies in Umm al-Fahm saw hundreds of protesters demonstrating outside Israeli Police station in the city and chanting slogans that condemned the police for their involvement in the crime wave.
The protesters chanted ""Police out!"" and demanded action against violence and criminality in Arab-majority areas of Israeli-occupied historical Palestine.
Another smaller protest in the central city of Tayibe saw protesters blocking a main road outside the city with burnt tires and clashing with Israeli police cops.
Arabs in today's Israel are Palestinians who stayed on their land following the creation of the occupying state in 1948 and their descendants. They make up about 20 percent of the country's nine million people.
By law, their rights are equal to those of Jewish citizens. But in practice they suffer discrimination in employment, housing, policing and other essentials.
Palestinians have long accused the Israeli police of turning a blind eye to gun violence among Arab Israelis and even complicity with criminal gangs.

"Settlers attack herders south of Hebron""",2/6/21 16:49,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123156,"
HEBRON, Saturday, February 06, 2021 (WAFA) - Hardcore Israeli settlers assaulted Palestinian herders today while they were grazing their sheep in the village of Al-Tuwana, near the town of Yatta in the occupied West Bank district of Hebron, according to witnesses.
Fo'ad Emour, a local official in charge of monitoring attacks in the area by colonial Israeli settlers, told WAFA that a group of hardcore Israeli settlers from the illegal settlement of Havat Maon assaulted herders and their sheep with stones and physically assaulted them. 
The settlers also forced the herders out of pasture land where they were grazing livestock.
The village is part of Masafer Yatta, a collection of about 19 nomadic Bedouin hamlets that rely heavily on livestock husbandry as a main source of living. 
Settler attacks against Palestinians in the area is commonplace, and often occur in the presence of the Israeli occupation military.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

SALFIT, Saturday, February 6, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation soldiers today attacked dozens of Palestinian farmers and activists who were planting trees in lands in the northern West Bank town of Bidya, west of the city of Salfit, and fired teargas canisters and stun grenades at them to force them to leave the area, according to a Palestinian official.
Walid Assaf, head of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, told WAFA that soldiers fired teargas canisters and charged the activists while they were planting trees in Bidya, causing several suffocation cases and bruises.
He said the soldiers prevented the tree-planting activity called for by the Commission in order to help the Palestinian residents of Bidya protect their lands from Israeli takeover for its illegal settlement purposes.
He said a settler had set up a caravan on Bidya land with the purpose to establish a settlement outpost as residents and activists intervened to prevent the stealing of the land.
The army intervened to protect the settler by preventing the Palestinian landowners from reaching and planting their lands, said Assaf.
""We will do whatever is necessary and by all means to prevent the establishment of the settlement outpost and kick out the settlers from this place,"" he said, pledging to continue with the tree-planting activity in that land to protect it.
Soldiers also attacked another tree-planting activity in the village of Beit Dajan, east of the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
Salim Abu Jash, a local activist, said soldiers charged the farmers and activists who were trying to plant 400 olive saplings in the threatened land and fired teargas and rubber bullets at them causing several injuries and suffocation cases.

JERUSALEM, Friday, February 5, 2021 (WAFA) – The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophilos III today condemned the attack committed by an Israeli extremist against the Romanian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem about three days ago.
A statement issued today by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed the condemnation and warned that “Israeli extremists’ attacks against churches and mosques in Jerusalem are alarmingly on the rise, and the failure of Israeli official authorities to deal with them and their tolerance towards such terrorist acts will definitely lead to more fueling of the conflict in the Holy City, and will keep it further away from achieving peace and stability.”
Theophilos III, the statement added, “called upon the international community to intervene by opening a dialogue with the Israeli government aiming at putting a stop to these terrorist attacks, and ending the continuous attempts of extremist Israeli groups to change the mosaic character of the city of Jerusalem by force through intimidating Christian and Muslim worshipers, attacking clerics, writing hate graffiti on walls and doors of churches and mosques, and also their hideous attempts to control church properties as evident by the attempts of Israeli radical groups to take over Orthodox Church properties in Jerusalem’s Jaffa Gate, specifically the Imperial Hotel, Petra Hotel and other real estate, using twisted methods and through corrupt deals filled with bribery, extortion and illegitimate pressure.”
The Orthodox primate stressed that the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and congregation stand by the Romanian Orthodox Patriarchate and “fully support them in facing this terrorist act that reflects the extent of the Israeli extremists’ hatred for the Christian religion in general, and the Orthodox Church in particular.”

HEBRON, February 5, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday dawn stormed several houses and detained a Palestinian across the west Bank, according to security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli soldiers rounded up a Palestinian after storming and searching his house in ‘Asira Ash-Shamaliya town, north of Nablus city.  
Meanwhile, soldiers forced their way into the southern section of Hebron city, where they broke into and searched two houses, turning them upside down.
Furthermore, a large Israeli military force forced their way into Tura and Nazlet Zeid villages, west and southwest of Jenin city, where they showered the courtyards of several houses with tear gas canisters, causing psychological distress and panic among the villagers, especially children and women. 
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

RAMALLAH, Friday, February 5, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Friday morning fatally shot a Palestinian near Ras Karkar village, northwest of Ramallah city, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli settlers opened fire toward an unarmed Palestinian man as he approached Jabal al-Raysan, killing him.
The settlers came from Sde Efraim farm, which does not appear on maps and is small colonial outpost set up by settlers atop Jabal al-Raysan, which was seized from Palestinian landowners in the area.  
Head of Ras Karkar Village Council, Radhi Abu Fkheida, identified the slain Palestinian as Khaled Nofal, the married 34-year-old father of a four-year-old boy. 
He added that the Israeli army stormed Nofal’s family house in the village in the early morning hours, and escorted his father, Maher, to Jabal al-Raysan to inspect the belongings of his deceased son. Maher had no information about the circumstances of Nofal’s death.
Israeli soldiers deployed at the scene prevented Palestinian medics from accessing the site.  
The circumstances surrounding the alleged stabbing attempt remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Israel forces and settlers have been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Video footage for similar alleged attacks appear to disapprove Israeli military claims, showing alleged Palestinian attackers did not even attempt to carry out any attacks. Some footage showed Israeli forces manipulating the crime scene following such killings.

"Israeli settler caught on camera assaulting a church in Jerusalem""",2/4/21 22:34,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123131,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, February 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Recordings of surveillance cameras have shown an Israeli settler carrying out an assault two days ago on the Romanian Orthodox Church in the neighborhood of Musrara in occupied Jerusalem, according to local sources.
The surveillance cameras recordings showed the settler smashing the lock of one of the church's gates and a surveillance camera belonging to it. The incident is believed to have taken place on February 2 night. 
Ramzi Khoury, Chairman of the Higher Presidential Commission for Church Affairs, strongly condemned the attack, saying that it was a result of the impunity granted to hardcore Israeli settlers who carry out attacks on Christian and Muslim holy places, especially in occupied Jerusalem.
Khoury directly blamed the Israeli occupation authorities for this attack and for all previous attacks on holy places. He called on all church-related and international organizations to uphold their responsibilities and ""take action against those trying to pull the region into a religious conflict.""
""The sanctity of our churches and mosques in Palestine is desecrated, the legacy of our ancestors is violated, and the cradle of Christ and the Prophet Muhammad are breached,"" said Khoury in a message to the world. 
""We want effective and deterrent action, we want the international community to intervene in the face of these violations and put an end to them.""

RAMALLAH, Thursday, February 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today detained 10 Palestinians and injured another across the occupied West Bank, according to local and Palestinian security sources.

"Palestine calls for strong, deterrent sanctions against Israel over community demolition""",2/4/21 11:46,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123122,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, February 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestine today called for the application of strong and deterrent sanctions against Israel over the demolition of a northern Jordan Valley community.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemned the demolition of Khirbet Humsa al-Fouqa community by Israeli occupation forces for the second time in 48 hours as ""a war crime and a crime against humanity that serves as a manifestation of the mindset of colonialism, racism and hate dominating the governing regime of Israel.""
""What the Israeli occupation forces perpetrated against the community amounts to an organized act of state terrorism committed by Israel, the occupying power, against the Palestinian people, property, and territory on a daily basis under the watch of the entire world and in total disregard of the international law, including the Geneva Conventions,"" the Ministry said in a statement.
While it welcomed the planned inspection visit of a European Union diplomatic delegation to the site, scheduled for today, it nevertheless stressed that such visits and condemnations are not sufficient as they fail to ensure protection for the displaced Palestinians.
""Condemnations will not deter Israel, the occupying state, against proceeding with the daily ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in the Jordan Valley,"" it added.
It urged the international community to impose deterrent sanctions against Israel, the colonialist-settler state, and hold it accountable for its violations and crimes and treat it as a rogue state.

HEBRON, Thursday, February 4, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli demolition of Palestinian houses continued today with the demolition of a house sheltering a family with five children of special needs in the south of the West Bank and destroying the area’s electricity grid, reported WAFA correspondent.
She said that army bulldozers raided Beit Awwa town, west of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, where they demolished a 180-square-meter house where a Palestinian family had lived with its five children with special needs, and destroyed an electricity grid that was supplying 10 homes in the same area with power.
Israel claimed the house, demolished for the second time, and the grid were in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military rule and makes up over 60 percent of the area of the West Bank.
Israel does not allow Palestinian construction or development in Area C, which it often reserves for building its illegal settlements.

He said that the Israeli forces demolished a one-story house that was still in the construction stage and about 70 meters of walls owned by a local resident under the pretext they were built without a permit.

"Israeli forces dismantle tents, structures in northern Jordan Valley""",2/3/21 13:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123106,"
TUBAS, Wednesday, February 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning dismantled tents and other structures in Khirbet Humsa al-Fouqa community, southeast of Tubas city, in the northern Jordan Valley, according to local sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces cordoned the community off before they raided it and dismantled the Palestinian-owned tents and structures.
Last night, Israeli troops stormed the community and prevented activists from building shelters for the some 85 residents whose tents were demolished yesterday and left without a shelter to protect them from the cold desert night weather.
The demolition was condemned by Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh as an act of “organized state terrorism, which involves ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population by favoring the settlers in the Israeli election campaigns for which our people pay for with their land, property, and suffering.”
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Military observation point set up at entrance of Ramallah-district town""",2/3/21 12:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123105,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, February 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today set up an observation point at the main entrance of Deir Nidham village, northwest of Ramallah, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli forces erected a fixed tent which would function as an observation point at the entrance of the village, which overlooks the bypass Road 465, two weeks after they escorted a bulldozer to the area and razed it.
In early January, the Israeli army sealed off the village purportedly as part of an active pursuit of the perpetrators who hurled stones at a female settler as she was driving past the village entrance and near the Israeli colonial settlement of Neve Tzuf, also known as Halamish, injuring her.
At the time, Israeli forces heavily deployed in and around the village, launching a massive house-to-house search campaign and detaining 20 villagers on suspicion of being involved in the attack and assaulting others.
Located 14 kilometers to the northwest of Ramallah city, Deit Nidham, also written as Deit Nizzam, has a population of some 1,000 and occupies a total area of 2,758 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a very small pocket of 130 donums, classified as Area B and accounting for 4.7 percent of the village land.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has seized at least 22 percent of the village’s land for the construction of the nearby colonial settlement of Neve Tzuf. It has confiscated more land for the construction of settler-only by-pass Road 465, which extends 7.4 kilometers on the village’s land, which connects the settlements with one another and encloses the village from four directions.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Israeli army conduct military drills, damage crops in southern Hebron""",2/3/21 12:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123104,"
HEBRON,  Wednesday, February 03, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli army today conducted military drills for the third consecutive day in Palestinian farmlands in the area of Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, according to local sources.
Fouad al-Amour, a local activist, told WAFA that the military carried out the drills using tanks and live fire, destroying crops in the area and causing psychological distress and panic among the residents, particularly the children.
The drills, he added, came to preempt an Israeli court ruling on a lawsuit filed by the Palestinian farmers in protest of the ongoing Israeli military destruction of their farmland.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

"Israeli forces to demolish farmer’s hut, retaining walls south of Bethlehem""",2/3/21 12:09,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123103,"
BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, February 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today delivered a notice to demolish a farmer’s hut and retaining walls in al-Khader town, south of Bethlehem, according to a local activist.
Ahmad Salah confirmed that Israeli troops stormed the western section of the town, known as Faghur, where they handed a resident a military notice to tear down his hut and retaining walls.
Located 4 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem city, al-Khader has a population of some 12,500 and occupies a total area of 8,280 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying some 1,200 dunams, accounting for almost 14.5 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Since the start of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, like so many other villages in Palestine, al-Khader has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Israel has constructed Efrat and NeveDaniyyel colonial settlements on an area of 6,329 dunums of Palestinian land, including a portion confiscated from al-Khader. It has also constructed a section of the apartheid wall, isolating some 5,620 dunums of the town’s land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

"Israeli military targets Gaza farmers, fishermen, detains one  """,2/3/21 12:02,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123102,"
GAZA, Wednesday, February 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli military today targeted Palestinian farmers and fishermen in the southern and northern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli forces fired live ammunition and smoke shells towards farmlands, east of the city of Khan Younis in the southern part of the strip, forcing farmers to leave their lands.
He added that a Palestinian, who remained unidentified, was detained by Israeli soldiers after he purportedly approached the border fence, south of Khan Younes.
Meanwhile, Israeli navy opened gunfire and water hoses toward fishermen as the latter were sailing only three nautical miles offshore Sudaniya coast, northwest of the city of Gaza, forcing them to flee and return to shore to avoid being hit or their boats damaged.
No casualties were reported in any of the attacks though.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, February 02, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces raided after midnight last night Khirbet Humsa al-Fouqa community in the northern occupied Jordan Valley and prevented activists from building shelters for the residents whose tents were demolished yesterday and left without a shelter to protect them from the cold desert night weather, according to a local source.
Mutaz Bisharat, an official with the Tubas governorate, told WAFA that Israeli forces seized the personal IDs of three activists in order to prevent them from proceeding with the building of the shelters.
Israeli occupation forces yesterday demolished and dismantled 40 structures owned by 11 Palestinian families in the community, and ordered the residents to leave the area.
Most of the structures in the community were demolished in November of last year in Israel’s efforts to empty the Jordan Valley of its Palestinian residents as it seeks to annex it despite international outcry against the illegal annexation of occupied Palestinian territories.

JENIN, February 1, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Monday evening shot and injured a Palestinian young man near Barta‘a town, southwest of the northern West Bank city of Jenin, according to local sources.
They confirmed that Israeli troops opened fire toward a young man from the nearby town of Silat al-Harithiya as he was attempting to enter Israel en route to his workplace, injuring him in one of his feet.
The casualty was rushed to a hospital for treatment. 
Meanwhile, a young man from Barta‘a was detained as he attempted to cross the checkpoint at the entrance of the town back to his house.
Hundreds of Palestinians work in Israel without a permit and often police chase them and detain them before sending them back to the occupied West Bank where work is more scarce than in Israel and pay is much less.
A large number of Palestinians, especially construction workers, pass the checkpoint every day, facing extreme overcrowding and often waiting for hours in line due inspection procedures as every person must pass through metal turnstiles one-at-a-time.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.

"Settlers graze cattle on Palestinian cultivated land south of Hebron""",2/1/21 15:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123082,"
HEBRON, Monday, February 1, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today grazed their cattle on Palestinian cultivated land to the east of Yatta town, south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Fuad al-'Amour, the Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committee in Masafer Yatta, told WAFA that a group of Israeli settlers allowed their cattle to graze on wheat and barely planted by Palestinian farmers in Khirbet al-Tha‘la, east of the town, in an attempt to seize the land to make room for the expansion of the nearby colonial settlements of Maon and Karmiel.
He called on international human rights organizations to intervene and rein in the Israeli occupation authorities’ practices and armed settler attacks against defenseless Palestinians in Masafer Yatta. 
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settler violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

"Rights group calls on Israel to immediately release a Palestinian UN worker from Jerusalem""",2/1/21 13:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123080,"
GENEVA, Monday, February 1, 2021 (WAFA) – The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor today expressed its grave concern over the Israeli authorities’ arrest of a UN Palestinian employee in Jerusalem, calling for her immediate and unconditional release.
The Israeli authorities arrested UN employee and human rights activist, Shireen Al-Araj, on January 25, in front of the Magistrate’s Court in Jerusalem. She was summoned to an interrogation on charges of ""contacting with foreign clients and persons."" Al-Araj, who holds an Israeli ID in addition to a UN diplomatic passport, had returned to the Palestinian territories after an Israeli ban that lasted for five years. Her lawyer had contacted her informing her that she has to return to the Palestinian territories to renew her residency papers or she will lose her residency and become a ""refugee"", which will deny her entry into the Palestinian territories again.
On January 24, at the border between Jordan and the Palestinian territories, Al-Araj was interrogated upon her arrival, where she was ordered to go to the Magistrate’s Court in Jerusalem the next day for further investigation by the Israeli police.
As she arrived at the court, Israeli intelligence agents stopped Al-Araj near the court door, took her to her home, and confiscated her computers and mobile phones. After that, she was taken to Petah Tikva prison in central Israel. The Israeli authorities prevented her lawyer and an Israeli lawyer appointed by the UN from meeting her or even being with her during the interrogation.
Al-Araj has been working with the UN in several organizations and programs, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA), the United Nations Population Fund and the Office of the High Commissioner in Turkey. This means she has a bright record in the human rights, humanitarian and service fields, which rules out the Israeli accusations against her, said Euro-Med in a press statement.
Israel restricts the work of UN workers in the Palestinian territories, despite the UN’s coordination with the Israeli authorities. The Israeli authorities also follow a strict policy with local and international human rights defenders and impose significant restrictions on granting them entry visas to Israel or accessing the Palestinian territories.
Last October, Euro-Med Monitor had complained to the United Nations Human Rights Council about the Israeli policy towards the work of international organizations and human rights defenders in the Palestinian territories. Euro-Med Monitor made it clear at the time that its chairman Rami Abdu, and some of its employees are constantly subjected to Israeli harassments, distortion campaigns and movement restrictions, against the background of the organization’s activity in exposing Israeli violations.
For his part, legal advisor at Euro-Med Monitor Muhammad Imad, said: ""The arrest of UN employee Shireen Al-Araj is a worrying measure that requires serious action by the UN and relevant agencies, especially since the background of the arrest and the charges against her clearly demonstrate the Israeli authorities’ violation of international legal rules that provide special protection for the UN’s employees and its agencies, which is a clear challenge to the UN agreements in the field of diplomatic and legal immunity for these groups."" Imad said there should be a decisive intervention by the UN to prevent Israel from continuing to violate the rights guaranteed to UN employees.
Arresting Al-Araj violates many international conventions, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention without legal basis. The Israeli authorities’ behavior opposes the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, as Article 7 of the agreement stipulates that ""States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel. In particular, States Parties shall take all appropriate steps to protect United Nations and associated personnel who are deployed in their territory.""
The Israeli authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Al-Araj, and respect the legal rules for the protection of United Nations personnel, said Euro-Med Monitor. Relevant UN agencies should investigate the incident and oblige Israel to provide explanations about its pursuit of UN employees in the Palestinian territories, it added.

JORDAN VALLEY, Monday, February 1, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities resumed today demolition of Palestinian-owned agricultural structures in Khirbet Humsa al-Fouqa in the northern Jordan Valley, according to a local human rights defender.
Aref Daraghme said an army force raided the community and immediately went on demolishing tents and structures.
Local official, Mutaz Bisharat, also said that the army has destroyed tents owned by three Palestinian families and seized a privately-owned car, as the operation was still ongoing.
Most of the structures in the community were demolished in November of last year in Israel’s efforts to empty the Jordan Valley of its Palestinian residents as it seeks to annex it despite international outcry against the illegal annexation of occupied Palestinian territories.

HEBRON, Sunday, January 31, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces ordered five Bedouin families in Masafer Yatta area to the south of Hebron to temporarily evict their homes to make way for military training exercises, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committees Rateb al-Jabour said Israeli forces handed five Palestinian families notices ordering them to temporarily evict the area and to remove their residential tents so that the army can conduct military drills there. 
“It is extremely difficult for whole families, including children, to be evacuated on such short notice. With no properly arranged place to stay, they must find a way to ensure shelter, food and drink away from home in the intense, grueling heat of the Jordan Valley,” said B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights center in a report on army eviction of families for exercise reasons.
“The frequent evacuations force residents to put their lives on hold. They evoke fear and uncertainty and involve a great deal of inconvenience,” it had said.
Palestinians living in these areas have to also worry about left behind ammunition and bombs, which have led to the death of many Palestinians, including children, over the past years.

RAMALLAH, Saturday, January 30, 2021 (WAFA) – A sharp rise in the Israeli army and settler attacks against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank prompted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates today to call on the United Nations Secretary-General and the Security Council to intervene and provide protection to the vulnerable Palestinian population under Israel’s occupation.
""The Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Security Council must assume their responsibilities designated by international law and provide international protection to our people and their just and legitimate national rights,"" said the Ministry in a statement, condemning the ongoing attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers against the Palestinian people and their rights.
It said the settlers have intensified their attacks and terror acts against the Palestinian civilians, their lands, and their properties in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
""The escalation in settler attacks is now dominating the scene on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory, and is manifested in various forms of killing, damaging property, seizing land, going after farmers, uprooting trees, and killing of livestock, among other forms of criminal escalation with the support of the occupying army,"" said the Foreign Ministry.
The last of these attacks, it said, was against Khan al-Lubban al-Sharqiya archeological site, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, which indicates an intention to take it over to serve Israel’s settlement expansion plans, while settlers also target the various Palestinian historical and archeological sites in an attempt to seize them.
The Ministry warned against treating settler attacks as normal and common incidents that recur daily without taking into consideration their dangerous consequence on Palestinian rights, and their disastrous repercussions on the chance of establishing a viable, contiguous, and sovereign Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.

Israeli settlers have escalated their violent attacks against Palestinian villages and areas across the occupied West Bank during the latest five weeks. Most of these attacks occurred in full view of the Israeli occupation forces which provided the settlers with protection.

QALQILIYA, Friday, January 29, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinians Thursday evening shut down the Nablus-Qalqiliya Road to Israeli settler movement, according to an activist.
Fatah Spokesman in Qalqiliya Murad Ishteiwi said that members of the Popular Resistance Committees closed the road connecting Nablus with Qalqiliya, successfully preventing groups of Israeli settlers from launching planned attacks on Palestinian vehicles and property.
Israeli forces intervened and opened fire towards the Palestinian activists who kept watch that night to fend off planned settler attacks, causing a number to suffocate from tear gas and detaining two.
One of the two detainees was identified 61-year-old Khairi Hannoun, who made headlines in last August after Israeli soldiers beat him and threw him to the ground as he participated in an anti-settlement and land grab protest in Shufa village, south of Tulkarm, while a soldier pressed his knee on his neck while on the ground, a scene reminiscent of the event that led to the death of African-American George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while detaining him on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Palestinian communities across the West Bank have been organizing “popular committees” to defend villages at night, and, on several occasions, these committees have defended the village successfully against night-time military raids and settler attacks.
There are over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers living in hundreds of colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

"Confrontations erupt as Israeli forces raid Ramallah-district town""",1/29/21 08:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123041,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, January 29, 2021 (WAFA) – Confrontations erupted Thursday evening when Israeli forces raided Silwad town, east of the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli forces barged their way into the town, triggering violent confrontations, during which the soldiers opened fire towards local youngsters who protested the raid. 
No injuries were reported though. 
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

BETHLEHEM, Thursday, January 28, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today uprooted dozens of grown olive trees, razed large tracts of Palestinian-owned land, and demolished retaining walls in an area south of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local official.
Hasan Breijieh, who heads the Bethlehem office of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, told WAFA that occupation soldiers raided Khillet al-Nahleh area of Wad Rahal village where they uprooted dozens of olive trees that were more than 10 years old, razed lands, and tore down retaining walls.
Two days ago, a group of hardcore settlers broke into the same area with their sheep and destroyed the crops before the village residents and farmers were able to kick them out.
Breijieh said that the area has been a regular target of the Israeli army and settlers’ attacks as a means to push its Palestinian residents out of their lands in order to take them over to expand the nearby illegal settlement of Efrat.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, January 27, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a residential structure and a shack in As-Sawahira Ash-Sharqiya town, southeast of the occupied city of Jerusalem, according to local sources.
Head of As-Sawahira Land Defense Committee, Younes Jaafar, told WAFA that Israeli forces  stormed Umm al-Rayyan area, near al-Tahadi School, where they tore down a residential structure and a livestock shack belonging to Isma‘il Saray‘a, before seizing the equipment.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, January 27, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today encroached upon and plowed a large tract of Palestinian farmland, east of Bethlehem district, according to a local official.
Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Comission, Hassan Breijah, told WAFA that scores of settlers, under the military protection, ploughed dozens of donums of Palestinian farmland belonging to the Zawahreh and al-Wahsh clans in al-Badiya Ash-Sharqiya (Eastern Wilderness), as a prelude to seize them.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements which have expanded rapidly over the last two decades across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and have severely constrained the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state.
The Israeli government provides settlers with roads, electricity, water, and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
While the international community has been vocal in its condemnation of Israeli settlement activity, it has taken few steps to pressure Israel into ceasing its colonial settlement enterprise.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

"Israeli forces dismantle two structures in Khan al-Ahmar""",1/27/21 12:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123020,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, January 27, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning dismantled two structures in Khan al-Ahmar village, east of Jerusalem, a local activist said.
Spokesman for Khan al-Ahmar, Eid Abu Khamis, told WAFA that an Israeli military force stormed the community, and dismantled two structures used for cattle breeding and seized their contents, without even handing the owners any demolition notices in advance.
Khan al-Ahmar is one of the Palestinian communities Israel is threatening with demolition and forcible transfer in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo Accords.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
Many Israel urge the outright annexation of Area C into Israeli territory.
The community is also located in E1 area, east of Jerusalem, where Israel plans to expand its colonial settlement blocs of Maaleh Adumin and Kfar Adumin and connect them to Jerusalem.
Expanding these settlements into E1 would isolate the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from one another, undermining prospects for territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian state and further cutting already heavily restricted Palestinian access to Jerusalem.
If the slated demolition and expulsion proceeds, this would mark the second time the community of Khan al-Ahmar is forcibly displaced.
The families were initially expelled from the Naqab region by Israeli military in 1950s.

Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees, Fuad al-‘Amour, told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers into Khirbet Umm Qassa in the Bedouin community of Azwadeen, in what is called the Eastern Slope, where the heavy machineries tore down the mosque, reducing it to rubble.
The demolition was carried out less than two weeks after soldiers posted demolition notices against the mosque and a local school, which serves 50 students from three marginalized communities, purportedly for being built without licenses.
Meanwhile, soldiers seized a tin-sheet health unit in Khirbet al-Rakiz hamlet in Masafer Yatta.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

"Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem pays more than $600,000 to protect Jaffa Gate properties""",1/26/21 13:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/123009,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, January 26, 2021 (WAFA) - Upon the instructions of Theophilos III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem deposited yesterday the sum of 2.1 million Israeli shekels (more than $600,000) into the Israeli Jerusalem District Court, to cover the entire rent value of the Jaffa Gate’s Imperial Hotel, according to a statement by the Patriarchate.
This comes as part of the Patriarchate’s efforts to protect the Imperial, which is subject of the ongoing court case regarding the suspicious Jaffa Gate deal dispute with the Israeli Ateret Cohanim settlement organization, which is trying to take over the hotel and surrounding areas in the historical Jaffa Gate, one of the gates of the old city of Jerusalem.
The Patriarchate of Jerusalem considered that this deposit is a pre-emptive and preventive measure aimed at countering any allegation by the settlement organization against the protected tenants, said the statement.
The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem affirmed that it will not spare any effort or money in protecting the properties of the Jaffa Gate, which is the historical gateway for the pilgrims of the Holy Land to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the rest of the holy sites in Jerusalem.
The Patriarchate also stressed in the statement that the protection of its properties and holy sites needs stability, steadfastness and great financial resources, which is what the Patriarchate of Jerusalem is working to achieve with the aim of preserving the authentic Christian presence in the Holy Land.
The Patriarchate also emphasized that it will continue its legal and lobbying efforts, locally and internationally, to protect its properties and holy shrines.

NABLUS, Tuesday, January 26, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers continued today to raze Palestinian-owned lands in the village of al-Lubban al-Sharqiya, south of the occupied northern West Bank city of Nablus, in order to expand an illegal Israeli favor of building settlement, local sources said.
They told WAFA that the Israeli bulldozers have been racing against time in levelling a nearby mountain and other areas in the vicinity of the illegal settlement of Eli aiming at expanding the settlement by adding more housing units to it.
To be noted, Israel has recently created new neighborhoods in the southern part of the settlement at the expense of Palestinian lands in the village, while razing other areas in favor of expanding the settlements' gas stations located at the main Ramallah-Nablus road.

Hasan Breijieh, who heads the Bethlehem office of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, told WAFA that the settlers broke into the Palestinian farms with their sheep in an effort to destroy the crops the farmers have been planting.
He said the farmers confronted the trespassers and succeeded in kicking them out of their lands but not before damage was done to the crops.
The settlers and Israeli occupation forces, said Breijieh, have recently escalated their attacks and violations against Palestinian villages in the Bethlehem district.

They said the military informed the residents that their tents and shelters where they live with their families are going to be demolished along with the clinic and council building.
Last month Israel informed 12 other families of the same village of the demolition of the tents they lived in with their families.
Zanouta, a community of 150 people in 27 families, is targeted by Israel after the illegal settlement of Shamaa was built next to it.
Removal of the Palestinian families from that village is going to allow Israel to expand the illegal settlement.

"'Suffocation and Isolation', a new report examines impact of 15 years of Israeli blockade on life in Gaza""",1/25/21 17:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122997,"
GENEVA, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor (Euro-Med) called for putting an end to the 15-year-old tragedy of the Gaza blockade; stressing that the current arrangements for holding general Palestinian elections require serious international guarantees that the blockade will end without conditions related to the election results.
In its annual report on the repercussions of the Gaza blockade, entitled ""Suffocation and Isolation - 15 Years of Israeli Blockade on Gaza"", Euro-Med Monitor examined the Israeli blockade effects on the lives of Gazans. The report compares Gazans’ living conditions before the blockade on one hand, and the current situation (15 years after) on the other.
The report confirms that during the past decade, the per capita economic losses in Gaza has reached about $9,000 due to the long-term closure and the military operations to which the Gaza Strip is subjected too. A United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report issued on November 25, 2020, concluded that the economic cost of the Israeli occupation on the Gaza Strip during the past decade is estimated at %16.7 billion.
Noura Erakat, Euro-Med Monitor’s member of Board of Trustees, said ""We are now entering 2021, the fifteenth year of Israel's naval blockade and land siege, and the global community seems unfazed by the unlivable conditions in the tiny coastal enclave or the fact that an entire generation has grown up isolated from the world - save for its contact with advanced weapons technologies raining down on them from Gaza's skies.
""These conditions are unconscionable and have no moral, legal, or policy justification. The siege must end without preconditions and condemned to the history of atrocities never to be repeated again."" The report indicated that unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is still among the highest in the world. After it reached 23.6% in 2005, in 2020, it reached 49%, while the per capita share of the GDP shrank by 27%.
Poverty rates also jumped from 40% in 2005 to 56% in 2020. Poverty gap increased as well from 14% to 20%, and the cost of lifting the Gaza population out of poverty quadrupled, from $209 million to $838 million.
The report stated that in 2020 the monthly rate of goods trucks entering the Gaza Strip was about 7,000. This number is not enough for half of Gaza’s needs, taking into account the population increase since 2005 and the number of trucks entering that year.
Before the blockade was imposed on the Gaza Strip, the monthly rate of Palestinians traveling via Erez crossing, run by Israel, was about 30,000 travelers. In 2019, the number was about 14,960 travelers, while in 2020, it dropped to 4,600 cases – a decrease of about 85% from the rate before the blockade in 2006.
As for the Rafah crossing bordering Egypt, in 2019 the monthly rate of travelers via the crossing was about 12,172 cases, while in 2020 the monthly average was only 4,245 cases.
The report confirmed that the crossing work was mainly affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus. It was closed for extended days, while hundreds of thousands of patients, students and businesspeople remained waiting for the opening of the crossing.
As for the health sector, it remains the most affected, showing a clear indication of the deteriorating humanitarian conditions. In addition to the acute shortage of medicines and medical equipment, hospitals and primary care centers are still operating at low levels of capacity. The situation further exacerbated after the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
The ongoing arrangements for holding the general Palestinian elections require local, regional and international mobility to end the blockade and provide guarantees that it will not be repeated in the future if it was lifted, said Euro-Med.
The right approach to ensure the success of the upcoming elections is the issuance of a binding international resolution to end the blockade, which international legal references agree to constitute as war crimes. Guarantees should be provided that the blockade will not be repeated (if it was ended), the will of the Palestinian voters will be respected, and a peaceful and democratic circulation is ensured in a way that achieves stability and prosperity for the Palestinians, demanded the human rights organization.

"Israel to demolish residential structures in Nablus-district town""",1/25/21 15:49,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122995,"
NABLUS,  Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today issued demolition notices against a residential building and two houses in Asira ash-Shamaliya village, north of the occupied city of Nablus, according to sources.
Mayor of Asira ash-Shamaliya, Hazem Yassin, told WAFA that Israeli forces raided the village, and handed Mohammad al-Sholi a notice to demolish his seven-story residential building and as well as Nabil and Bader Hamadneh notices to demolish their houses.
Yassin said that the structures slated for demolition are located in Area C, but still within the master plan of the village, while affirming the owners have obtained the necessary building licenses from the municipality.
He warned that if the demolition is carried out, 12 families will be displaced and hue material losses will be inflicted upon the owners and tenants of the five stores in the first storey of the building. 
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

BETHLEHEM, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today assaulted Palestinian shepherds in Kisan village, to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, local sources said.
Mayor of Kisan, Ahmad Ghazal, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Ibei Hanahal hurled rocks toward a number of shepherds, injuring one, and released dogs towards the sheep, devouring the heads of several sheep. 
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides to the settlement outpost of Ibei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land. 
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

"Israeli settlers uproot dozens of olive saplings east of Hebron""",1/25/21 14:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122991,"
HEBRON, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today uprooted dozens of olive saplings in the area of al-Baq‘a, east of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local sources said.
Aref Jaber, a local activist, told WAFA that settlers, under the Israeli military protection, broke into over 25 donums of Palestinian-owned land in the area, and uprooted dozens of the olive saplings planted there.
The settlers came from the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Kiryat Arba. 
Jaber called on international and human rights organizations to strengthen the steadfastness of Palestinian landowners in the area and that the competent authorities provide them with access to necessary services as they are under constant threat from the Israeli forces and settlers.
The lands of Al-Baqa'a are considered the ""food basket"" of Hebron, and they're subjected to almost daily attacks by the Israeli forces and settlers, including the razing and demolitions of water pools, with the aim of forcibly kicking Palestinians out in favor of settlers.

"Israeli forces demolish house, injure dozens northwest of Bethlehem""",1/25/21 14:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122990,"
BETHLEHEM, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a Palestinian house under construction and injured dozens in al-Walaja village, northwest of the Bethlehem city, according to sources.
Mayor of al-Walaja, Khader al-A‘araj, told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to northwestern part of the village, where the heavy machinery tore down a two-story house under construction, purportedly for being built without a permit.
The house owner was identified as Mohammad Abdul-Latif Jayyousi.
During ensuing confrontations, the soldiers opened fire towards local youths who protested the demolition, injuring a number with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing others to suffocate from tear gas inhalation.
Located at a horizontal distance of 5 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem, al-Walaja has a population of some 2,800 and occupies a total area of 4,328 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying 113 dunams and accounting for only 2.6 percent of the village’s total area. This area is classified as Area B. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
An area of 4,209 dunams of the village, accounting for 97 percent, is completely isolated by the section of Israel’s apartheid wall. The majority of this land is agricultural land, forests and open spaces.
The village is flanked by two Israeli colonial settlements; Gilo from the east and Har Gilo from the south.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israeli military prevents maintenance works at Hebron’s Ibrahimi Mosque""",1/25/21 12:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122989,"
HEBRON, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli military today prevented maintenance works at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local official.
Director of the Ibrahimi Mosque Sheikh Hafthi Abu Sneinah told WAFA that Israeli forces prevented the staff of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee from carrying out maintenance works for the archeological Ibrahimi Mosque, including wall painting, stone cleaning using earthen plaster, besides to cleaning historical Islamic inscriptions, purportedly for lacking the necessary permit from the competent authorities.
He affirmed that carrying out restoration works inside the holy site is part of the Ministry of Islamic Waqf and Religious Affairs’ mandate and slammed the prevention of the restorations are part of the Israeli occupation authorities’ attempts to impose their control on the site.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

RAMALLAH, Monday, January 25, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli military today demolished expansions and improvements in al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya village, south of Nablus city, according to a local source. 
Mayor of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, Yaqoub Ewais, told WAFA that the Israeli forces cordoned off Al-Khan area in the village in the morning hours as an Israeli bulldozer proceeded to demolish the expansions and improvements, including the gates and windows, for the second time in a row, and damaged the barbed wire surrounding the area.
Khan Al-Lubban, an Ottoman-era archaeological site, covers an area of 300 donums and contains a spring of water. For years, the area has been subject to continuous attacks by the Israeli authorities and settlers, who aim to seize it, as it is located in the area connecting the illegal Israeli settlements of Eli and Ma'ale Levona.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

BETHLEHEM, Sunday, January 24, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces ordered today the demolition of Palestinian-owned agricultural structures in the village of al-Khader, to the south of Bethlehem City in the occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Ahmad Salah, a local activist, told WAFA that Ibrahim Sulaiman Salah, a local Palestinian villager, was informed by the Israeli occupation army that a shack of his own which he uses for stocking harvest will be demolished, under the pretext that it was built without an Israeli permit.
In addition to the shack, the Israeli occupation forces ordered the demolition of a water retention well in the village, used by farmers for irrigation of crops.
The shack and retention well slated for demolition are built in a land classified as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank where Israel retains military and civilian control.
Palestinians living in this area are frequently exposed to the danger of home demolitions by the occupation authorities under the pretext of lacking an Israeli permit.

HEBRON, Sunday, January 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Colonial Israeli settlers today attacked Palestinian herders and chased them off pastures in the area of Msafer Yatta, south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Fo'ad Omour, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli settlements in Hebron, told WAFA that a group of settlers from the illegal settlements of Ma'on and Carmel, nearby, assaulted the herders while grazing their livestock in the area and forced them to leave. No injuries were reported.
Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians are commonplace, but assaults on defenseless Palestinian communities across the West Bank, including on farmers and herders, have seen a surge in the recent few weeks. 
Most of these attacks occurred in the presence of the Israeli occupation army, which did nothing to stop the attacks and rather provided protection for settler vandals.
Armed settlers and soldiers often prevent Palestinian shepherds from herding in the open pastures of the occupied West Bank in order to force them to abandon the area.

TULKARM, Sunday, January 24, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian worker died on Sunday early morning due to a heart attack resulting from the inhalation of toxic teargas fired by Israeli occupation soldiers at him near the village of Far'oun, south of Tulkarm city in the occupied West Bank, witnesses said.
Fo'ad Sebti Joudeh, 48, was among dozens of Palestinian workers who were on their way to their workplaces inside Israel, when Israeli occupation soldiers fired teargas canisters at them as they tried to cross a gate in the Israeli segregation barrier near the village. 
The man reportedly died from a heart attack shortly after inhaling the toxic gas. His body was moved to a hospital in nearby Nablus city, ahead of his funeral in his hometown of Iraq al-Tayeh.
Joudeh's brother said his brother had not suffered any disease prior to the deadly incident, which proves that the excessive use of teargas by the occupation forces was behind the sudden heart attack that killed the 48-year-old man.
Joudeh is a father of four children, the eldest of whom is ten years old.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, January 24, 2021 (WAFA) – Over a thousand Israelis resumed their weekly demonstrations last night against their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for the long-serving Israeli leader to resign over corruption charges and mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.
The main demonstration was held in Paris Square in occupied Jerusalem near Netanyahu’s official residence, while smaller protests were staged at intersections and bridges across the country.
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial was scheduled to resume last week, but was postponed indefinitely amid the tighter restrictions.
The Israeli government's handling of the coronavirus crisis has also fueled the protests. With the country’s third lockdown still in place, Israel’s economy has been hit hard by virus restrictions amid surging infection rates.
The protests have taken place each week since last summer, primarily at Paris Square in occupied Jerusalem near Netanyahu's official residence, and continued despite lower turnout in the cold winter nights.

Dozens of settlers protected by an army escort gathered at Gush Etzion junction and blocked the road to the Palestinian traffic, while waving Israeli flags and chanting racist slogans.
In the meantime, clashes erupted with Israeli occupation forces as they raided the village of Beit Fajjar, near the city of Bethlehem, during which the forces heavily used teargas to disperse the protesters.
The recent few weeks witnessed a noticeable increase in violent attacks by Israeli settlers against defenseless Palestinian communities across the occupied West Bank.

The settlers from the illegal Susya settlement also attacked journalists covering the event and chased them with their dogs causing injuries to some, including WAFA staff Hamza Hattab, who required hospitalization, and Mashhour Wahwah.
The activity was held in solidarity with the Palestinian residents of Khirbet al=Tawimin and Masafer Yatta in their struggle against the Israeli takeover of their lands and the settlements, according to Fouad al-Amour, one of the activists.

"Unrestrained Israeli settler rampage in the occupied territories continues with assault on trees""",1/23/21 14:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122970,"
SALFIT, Saturday, January 23, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers continued with their daily uncontrolled rampage in the occupied West Bank today with the destruction of over 120 olive trees in an area north of Kufr al-Dik village, east of Salfit in the north of the West Bank, according to witnesses.
They said that the settlers broke into the area, cut or uprooted 120 olive trees owned by two local residents, and broke the doors and windows of a room owned by another resident and used to store farming equipment, and stole its contents.
Settler rampage in the occupied territories has been on the rise while the Israeli occupation authorities do not do anything about it.

"Israeli settlers’ hooliganism in the occupied territories leaves many Palestinians injured, property damaged - UN""",1/23/21 10:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122966,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, January 23, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers’ hooliganism in the occupied territories left at least eight Palestinians injured and dozens of Palestinian-owned trees and vehicles damaged in the two-week period between 5 and 18 January, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory.
In the report entitled Protection of Civilians, the UN agency said that an 11-year-old girl was stoned and injured near her house in Madama in the Nablus area in the north of the West Bank, as settlers attempted to abduct her without success.
Six men were also physically assaulted in separate incidents while working their land near Aqraba also near Nablus and Kafr Malik near Ramallah, and a man sustained injuries during stone-throwing at Palestinian vehicles in the Ramallah area.
It said at least six Palestinian vehicles were damaged in daily stone-throwing incidents while additional cars in East Jerusalem were vandalized during settler protests against the death of an Israeli boy in a car chase with the Israeli Police. The boy was involved in attacking Palestinian vehicles on West Bank roads.
Israeli settlers also damaged over 230 olive trees and saplings near the villages of Beit Ummar near Hebron in the south of the West Bank and Jalud near Nablus, said the report.
Israeli occupation forces also uprooted about 1,370 Palestinian-owned trees in Deir Ballut near Salfit in the north of the West Bank and Beit Ummar during the reporting period on grounds that the land had been declared ‘state land’.
In 2020, the Israeli authorities uprooted an estimated 4,164 Palestinian trees, nearly 60 percent more than in 2019.
They also confiscated 237 sheep near Wadi Fuqin near Bethlehem in the south of the West Bank, claiming they were grazing in an area declared as a nature reserve. The herder was issued a fine of $15,200.
Meanwhile, and citing the lack of building permits, the Israeli occupation authorities demolished or seized 24 Palestinian-owned structures across Area C of the occupied West Bank between January 5 and 18, displacing 34 people and otherwise affecting almost 70, said OCHA.
Ten of the targeted structures, including homes, animal shelters and mobile latrines, were located in the Beit Iksa Bedouin community near Jerusalem, where 27 people, half of them children, were displaced.
Four of these structures had been provided as humanitarian aid.
A family of seven living in an ancient building in Khirbet Farseen near Jenin in the north of the West Bank was displaced following the removal or demolition of windows, doors, water pipes, electricity cables and a toilet they had added to their home, which the Israeli authorities claim is located in an archaeological site.
A recently constructed school in Umm Qussa near Hebron received a ‘removal notice’ under Military Order 1797, which allows for its demolition within 96 hours.
Israeli forces carried out 161 search-and-arrest operations and arrested 157 Palestinians across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and 79 Palestinians, including 14 children, were injured across the West Bank in clashes with Israeli forces during the reporting period.
Most of those wounded (59) sustained their injuries in protests against the establishment of two settlement outposts near Al Mughayyir and Deir Jarir villages near Ramallah or against settlement activities near Kafr Qaddum near Qalqiliya. Fifty-five of the injured people were treated for inhaling tear gas, 14 were shot with live ammunition, eight were hit by rubber bullets, and the remaining ones were physically assaulted.
On 5 January, at the Gush Etzion junction near Hebron, a 25-year-old Palestinian man approached a security guard of an Israeli settlement and allegedly threw a knife at him, following which the guard shot and killed the Palestinian, according to Israeli reports.

"Occupation forces attack weekly protests in Deir Jarir, Kafr Qaddum""",1/22/21 16:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122961,"
Friday, January 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today attacked dozens of Palestinian protesters taking part in the weekly nonviolent anti-settlements protests in the villages of Deir Jarir and Kafr Qaddum in the occupied West Bank, witnesses told WAFA.
In Deir Jarir, northeast of Ramallah, several Palestinian protesters sustained suffocation from teargas when Israeli occupation forces fired teargas and rubber-coated rounds at them while taking part in the weekly nonviolent protest against Israel's plan to build a new settlement outpost in the area.
The village has been a frequent target of recurrent attacks by Israeli occupation forces and colonial settlers over the past few months.
Meanwhile, at least one Palestinian was injured when Israeli occupation forces attacked the weekly protest against colonial Israeli settlements, which took place in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near the city of Qalqilia in the occupied West Bank.
Morad Shtewi, an official in charge of the popular resistance file in the village, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring one of them in the hand. He was moved to hospital for treatment. Others also sustained suffocation from gas inhalation, and were treated at the scene by local medics.

"Israeli army targets farmers in southern Gaza Strip""",1/22/21 13:02,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122958,"
GAZA, Friday, January 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli army today targeted Palestinian farmers tending to their lands east of Khan Younis city in the southern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli military forces stationed in military towers along the border, east of the city, opened gunfire on farmers tending their crops in al-Fakhari area, forcing them to flee.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Settlers hurl Molotov cocktails toward Palestinian houses south of Nablus""",1/22/21 10:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122955,"
NABLUS, Friday, January 22, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers on Thursday evening hurled Molotov cocktails toward two Palestinian houses in Burin village, south of Nablus city, according to local sources.
They confirmed that the settlers stormed the southern part of the village, and threw Molotov cocktails toward two houses.
The villagers rushed to fend off the settler attack and help the families extinguish the fire, leading to confrontations with Israeli soldiers who raided the village.
The soldiers opened fire towards the villagers, causing many to suffocate from tear gas inhalation, and rounded up a villager, in his 30s.  
The attack was perpetrated shortly after groups of hardcore settlers sealed off several roads and junctions and attacked Palestinian vehicles with stones and empty bottles.
Also on Thursday evening, settlers attacked a Palestinian vehicle near the entrance of Burin village, south of Nablus, injuring a three-year-old child in his face.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

‘Ala Sawafta told WAFA that a group of settlers attacked his car as he was driving from Ramallah to Tubas city, smashing the windshield, the front door and back door glass of his car and wounding his three-year-old son, Jad, in his face.

RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 21, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers tonight attacked with stones and empty bottles Palestinian vehicles in at least three junctions in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources. No injuries were reported.
In the northern Jordan Valley, settlers from the illegal settlement of Mehola attacked Palestinian vehicles driving at route 90, which is immediately located next to the colonial settlement. 
Meanwhile, settlers attacked Palestinian vehicles at Nablus-Ramallah road, just near the village of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, and blocked a section of the road to the Palestinian traffic for some time.
Settlers also attacked with stones Palestinian vehicles and passers-by near the village of Jit, east of Qalqilia city, but were fended off by local Palestinians who blocked the main road to the village in the face of the settlers. 
The three attacks reportedly occurred in full sight of Israeli occupation soldiers who did nothing to stop the settlers and rather provided them with protection. 
There has been an increase in settler-related attacks against Palestinians and their properties during the past few week.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

GAZA, Thursday, January 21, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today opened water dams and pumped rainwater toward Palestinian farmlands on the eastern border of the Gaza Strip, said WAFA correspondent. 
He said the Israeli occupation authorities flooded farmlands with rainwater causing damages to crops estimated at thousands of dollars.
He noted that every year, the Israeli occupation army intentionally opens water dams and channels to flood agricultural lands in Gaza without prior notice.
Last year in January, Israeli forces damaged large amounts of crops when they released rainwater several times into the besieged territory.
In 2007, Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the strip, effectively turning the coastal enclave into an open-air prison, where basic necessities such as food, fuel and medicines are severely controlled.
Nearly 70 percent of Gaza's population is food insecure.

"Israeli army teargas kills Misk, before she was even born""",1/20/21 17:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122937,"
By Ihab Rimawi
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, January 20, 2021 (WAFA) - Misk, still unborn, died in the womb of her seventh-month pregnant mother, Areej, due to complications she suffered as a result of inhaling and suffocating from teargas fired by the Israeli occupation army at her home in the village of al-Mughayyer, east of Ramallah, last week.
Misk's heart stopped last Thursday evening after her mother's health deteriorated and suffered severe bleeding and poisoning. She was admitted to the operating room twice in a row.
Areej Abu Alyya, 37, needed 50 blood units over the past few days, and she was kept in the intensive care unit all this time in a very serious health condition.
The Abu Alyya's house is located in a volatile area east of the village, which witnesses almost daily confrontations between the occupation army and the residents. More than 100 teargas canisters fall in the vicinity of the house every week.
Iyad Abu Alyya, Areej's husband, said: ""We live in a very dangerous area. Teargas canisters are scattered around the house and inside it.
I can no longer collect them immediately to throw them away from children's reach."" The occupation forces intentionally fire a barrage of teargas canisters at the houses in that area, forcing many residents to leave their homes even late at night.
""We will be deep asleep when we are suddenly awoken at the sound of a teargas grenade coming through the windows of the house. I rush to get my eight children out of the house despite the cold weather and put them in my truck to take them to the center of the village. We return home in the morning. This is something we do often, "" said Iyad.
Last Thursday morning, there were small confrontations in the vicinity of the Abu Alyya house. The occupation forces responded by firing teargas canisters, most of which fell near his house leading to Areej suffering severe suffocation.
Areej was rushed to the Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah. Her condition was difficult and she was admitted to the operating room after doctors realized that the heart of her baby had stopped beating.
""Every week I take my children to the village doctor, all of them with severe symptoms as a result of inhaling teargas and suffering from a burn in the lungs, which causes them permanent vomiting, chest pain, and severe cough. It seems that the gas fired by the occupation forces is a new and toxic type, "" said Iyad Abu Alyya.
A few meters away from the Abu Alyya house, 13-year-old Ali Abu Alyya was killed on December 4 by Israeli army gunfire, and less than 50 meters away, Hamdi al-Naasan was also shot dead by the soldiers on January 20, 2019.
The occupation forces have been targeting al-Mughayyer for a long time. Confrontations take place almost daily. Its entrances are closed by the army every now and then, and the occupation forces pursue its youth either by detaining them or shooting and either wounding or killing them.

"Israeli forces extend closure of Hebron’s Ibrahimi Mosque""",1/20/21 13:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122931,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, January 20, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today extended the closure of the Ibrahimi Mosque in the southern West Bank city of Hebron for another week, according to sources.
The Mosque Director, Hefzi Abu Sneineh told WAFA that the Israeli authorities extended the closure of the mosque for another week, banning the entry of Palestinian worshipers and visitors to the holy site purportedly as a precautionary measure to curb the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier this month, the holy site was closed for 13 days under the same pretext.
Abu Sneineh noted that the Israeli authorities use flimsy excuses to close the mosque whenever they want, and according to what serves their interests.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Palestinian injured during an Israeli army shelling of a location in the Gaza Strip""",1/20/21 08:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122928,"
GAZA, Wednesday, January 20, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian man was injured last tonight by shrapnel from an artillery shell fired by Israeli occupation forces at a site in the Gaza Strip, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that an artillery shell fired by an Israeli tank stationed behind the common borders with Gaza hit a house in Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip injuring one resident who was transferred to hospital in Deir Al-Balah.
A medical source told WAFA that the shrapnel hit the man in the leg and he was reported in stable condition.
Israeli tanks also targeted locations east of Gaza City, as well as east of Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip, and a site east of the town of Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip.
The Israeli artillery also fired at least one shell towards a site northwest of the town of Beit Lahia, in the northern Gaza Strip, destroying it and setting it on fire.
The strike caused damage to some homes near the targeted sites.
Israeli warplanes yesterday attacked several sites in the Rafah and Khan Younis governorates in the south of the Gaza Strip without causing any casualties.

"Israeli forces conduct military drills in northern Jordan Valley, destroy crops""",1/19/21 17:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122925,"
JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, January 19, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli forces conducted military training in multiple areas in the northern Jordan Valley, causing significant damage to Palestinian land, according to a local activist.

Aref Daraghmeh, a human rights activist, said Israeli army forces conducted military training in al-Farisiya, Sahl al-Burj, and al-Maleh areas, destroying agricultural crops and land planted with wheat.

The Israeli army usually conducts drills in the occupied West Bank, especially in the Jordan Valley, after forcefully displacing dozens of local Palestinian families due to the proximity of their homes to the training sites.

Palestinians living in these areas have to also worry about unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli army after the drills, which have led to the death of many Palestinians, including children, over the past years.

"Despite a slight decline in Israeli demolitions during December, 2020 marks a 4-year high in demolitions and displacements - UN""",1/19/21 13:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122920,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, January 19, 2021 (WAFA) – While there was a slight decrease in Israeli demolition of Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank and East Jerusalem during December compared to other months of last year, 2020 nevertheless marks a four-year high in demolition and displacements, including incidents affecting donor-funded structures, according to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory.
In December, said the report titled West Bank Demolitions and Displacement - December 2020, the Israeli occupation authorities demolished, forced people to demolish, or seized 67 Palestinian-owned structures across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the displacement of 50 people, including 30 children, and otherwise affecting the livelihoods or access to services of over 400 others.
All structures were located in Area C of the occupied West Bank or East Jerusalem and were targeted due to a lack of building permits, which are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain.
Seven of the structures located in three Area C communities had been provided as humanitarian aid, for a total cost of over 14,000 euros.
In one of the largest incidents, which took place in the Bedouin community of Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja in the Jericho area, the Israeli authorities seized without prior notice seven structures, including three homes under construction and four livelihood-related structures, affecting 45 people.
Additional five structures were targeted in three Bedouin communities in the Jerusalem governorate, located in or around an area planned for a large settlement project (the ""E1"" plan). The plan, currently in its final approval stage, entails the construction of 3,500 housing units, placing 18 Bedouin communities at heightened risk of forcible transfer.
Additionally, in the northern Jordan Valley (Hammamat al Maleh), a donor-funded kindergarten serving a number of Bedouin communities received a demolition order.
Also in Area C, next to Suba village in the Hebron area, the Israeli authorities bulldozed some 30 dunums of agricultural land, on grounds that the area had been declared ‘state land’. As a result, agricultural terraces and surrounding fences were destroyed, and some 930 olive, grape, almond and cactus trees were uprooted, undermining the livelihoods of eight families.
The cumulative number of structures demolished or seized in 2020 (849) across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the number of Palestinians displaced as a result (996) are the largest since 2016. The number of donor-funded aid structures targeted in 2020 (156) is also the highest since 2016.
Commitments made by the Israeli authorities to halt the demolition of inhabited homes during the COVID-19 crisis have been largely disregarded, said the OCHA report. Along with the repeated targeting of water and sanitation facilities, these practices have undermined the ability of already vulnerable families to adequately cope with the pandemic.
One of the major trends observed in 2020 was the increased use of military orders and other legislation, preventing or limiting people’s ability to legally challenge the targeting of their homes and sources of livelihood in Israeli courts.
In Area C, 30 percent of the structures targeted in 2020 (202 out of 666) were seized without prior warning, up from 11 percent in 2017 and 8 percent in 2016. Another 13 percent of the structures in Area C (88) were demolished on the basis of Military Order 1797, which provides a 96-hour notice and very limited grounds for legally challenging a demolition.
In East Jerusalem, there was a major increase in the proportion of structures demolished by their owners, following the issuance of demolition orders, which reached 47 percent in 2020, up from an average of 23 per cent in the previous four years. This is attributed to new Israeli legislation, which limited the authority of Israeli courts to intervene and enabled the ability of the West Jerusalem Israeli municipality to exert pressure on affected families to demolish their properties by themselves.

Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that five of the homes are owned by members of the Dawabshe family, two of them already inhabited, and the others are either completed and not yet inhabited or still in the construction stage.
While most of Duma village is designated as per the 1994 Palestinian-Israeli Oslo Accords as Area B, which is under Palestinian administration and Israeli security control, some areas, where the village wants to expand to accommodate its rising population, are designated as Area C, which is under full Israeli military rule where Palestinians are not allowed to build or develop without Israeli permission, which is never obtained.

"Israel detains at least 15 Palestinians, some from East Jerusalem, says Prisoner Society""",1/18/21 12:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122906,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, January 18, 2021 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation forces detained this morning at least 15 Palestinians from the occupied territories, some of them from East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society (PPS).
Israeli forces detained four Palestinians from East Jerusalem, two from Isawiyya and two from al-Tur neighborhoods.
Local sources told WAFA that the forces used dogs when searching the homes and detaining the two Palestinians in Isawiyya.
Two others were detained from the town of Abu Dis, just outside East Jerusalem, and one more from the Jerusalem-area village of Al-Zayyem.
Forces also detained two Palestinians after raiding and searching their homes in Kubar village, northwest of Ramallah.
Another was detained during an army raid of Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem in the south of the West Bank.
One was also detained in Abu Daeef village, east of Jenin in the north of the West Bank, after raiding, searching and ransacking his family home.
The others were detained in Hebron and Nablus districts, said the PPS.

"Hala, 11, miraculously saved from Israeli settlers who attempted to abduct her""",1/18/21 11:42,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122903,"
By Bassam Abu al-Rub
NABLUS, Monday, January 18, 2021 (WAFA) - Hala Mashhour al-Qat, 11, from Madama village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, sat on her bed at the emergency ward in Rafidya Government Hospital with the effects of the shock and the attack she encountered the day before were still very visible on her face.
Hala, the fifth-grade student, was attacked by a group of Israeli settler thugs when they attacked her family's home yesterday evening, causing her bruises and cuts in her face when she was attacked with stones as the settlers tried to abduct her. Her screaming and call for help and the quick intervention of her uncle and her mother miraculously prevented her abduction and very likely murder.
Hala was on her way from her house to her uncle’s, which is only a few meters away, in order to study for a school exam in Islamic studies scheduled for the next day, as she told WAFA.
""While I was leaving home, I was surprised by a group of settlers.
One of them started to throw stones at me and I was hit in my face. I couldn’t see anything, and I started screaming and calling on my mother and uncles for help. They came quickly and were able to rescue me from them,"" Hala said, still trembling from the horrifying experience.
Hala, sitting on her hospital bed, had difficulty continuing to talk due to the pain in her mouth and teeth, but her health condition was stable, according to the doctors who pointed to cuts and bruises in her nose and mouth.
This was not the first time Israeli settlers attack Madama and surrounding villages, targeting homes with stones, and attacking people, especially in the areas near the illegal settlement of Yitzhar, known to harbor extremist Jewish thugs.
Hala’s father, Mashhour, said that while he was at work at about three o'clock, he received a telephone call from his wife telling him to come home immediately after some 20 settler thugs have attacked their house.
""I did not realize what was happening but my brothers told me that my daughter Hala was injured, and so I immediately went to the hospital where Hala was getting treatment,"" he told WAFA, explaining that the settlers have also injured his wife in the foot while she was trying to free their daughter from the settlers and that some window in their house were broken.
""We are living under constant terror,"" he said, explaining that his house is about three kilometers away from Yitzhar settlement. ""Our homes and property are under constant attack from the settlers."" Ghassan Douglas, how monitors Israeli settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, said that settlers attacked al-Qat family house, located in the southeastern section of the village, with stones and smashed its windows, which led to the injury of their daughter, Hala, wounding her head and face as they tried to kidnap her.
He said that the warnings he made a few weeks ago were translated on the ground. The settlers are trying to kill people in their homes and in their vehicles while they are on the roads. What they have done over the past days proves their intention to commit crimes against the Palestinians, he said.
Douglas added, ""On a daily basis, we receive messages from people of being attacked by settlers who are now blocking the streets."" He expressed hope that the tragedy of the Dawabshe family a few years ago will not be repeated when settlers set the Dawabshe home in a nearby village on fire burning the father, mother and a baby alive, while one child, Ahmad, who suffered burns all over his body, was the only survivor of the deadly arson attack by the settlers.
He warned that the rural areas in the Nablus governorate are witnessing a serious rise in settler attacks and a worrying rise in the number of settler terrorist groups who run freely in the occupied territories, terrorizing the Palestinian civilians and threatening their lives and property while the Israeli army and government are not doing anything to stop them, rather indirectly encourage them.

"Israeli warplanes attack southern Gaza Strip, cause damage to property but no injuries""",1/18/21 09:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122900,"
GAZA, Monday, January 18, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes attacked very early this morning areas in the south of the Gaza Strip causing heavy damage to property but no injuries, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that an Israeli warplane fired two missiles at a location east of Rafah, causing fire and destroying it in total, and at an open agricultural area causing a deep hole in the ground and damage to the site.
Another warplane fired two missiles at a location ear of Khan Yunis, destroying it and damaging private property.
Israel claimed the attacks came after two projectiles were fired from Gaza into the sea and fell near the southern Israeli coast without causing any damage or bodily harm.
Meanwhile, Israeli military vehicles infiltrated this morning the borders east of Khan Yunis and levelled agricultural lands, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said the military vehicles went dozens of meters deep into the besieged Gaza Strip, destroyed land and built dirt mounds under the cover of fire and smoke before leaving the area and returning to the Israeli side of the border.

"Israel to demolish mosque under construction, school in Masafer Yatta""",1/17/21 17:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122890,"
HEBRON, Sunday, January 17, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli occupation forces notified to demolish a mosque under construction and a primary school in Masafer Yatta area to the south of Hebron, the southern occupied West Bank, according to Fouad al-Amour, a local activist.

He told WAFA that Israeli forces distributed notices for the demolition of a primary school and a mosque under construction in Khirbet Um Gussa, a locale in Masafer Yatta, citing unpermitted construction as a pretext.

The school's director, Yusef Al-Basaita, stated that the school includes 50 students and serves three marginalized communities in Masafer Yatta, which is classified as Area C under full Israeli military control. It is one of 17 Tahadi schools - named after the Arabic word for “challenge” - in Area C.
All 17 schools were built by the Palestinian Authority; many with European Union funding, to provide education to otherwise marginalized rural communities dispersed throughout the West Bank.

Israel constantly demolishes structures built by Palestinians in Area C, including the Jordan Valley, claiming they were built without a permit, rarely, if ever, issued for Palestinians. It does not allow any development there while using the occupied land for its illegal settlement activity.

Area C makes up more than 60 percent of the area of the occupied West Bank.

"Girl injured as she survives kidnapping attempt by settlers near Nablus""",1/17/21 16:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122887,"
NABLUS, Sunday, January 17, 2021 (WAFA) – An 11-year-old Palestinian girl sustained injuries today as a group of hardcore settlers attacked her family's house in the village of Madama, to the south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Settlers from the nearby settlement of Yitzhar, notorious for its hardcore settler community, attacked a house with stones in the village and smashed its windows, injuring Hala Mash'hour Qutt with a stone in her head.
The settlers also attempted to kidnap the girl, but were fended off by local Palestinian residents who thwarted the kidnapping attempt and forced the settlers out of the village.
The girl was moved to a hospital in nearby Nablus city for medical treatment.
The settlement of Yitzhar is notorious for its hardcore Jewish settler community who in the past committed several attacks against Palestinians and their property, including arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Settler vandalism of Palestinian property in the occupied territories is almost a daily occurrence, and attacks by settlers are rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.

"Israel prevents maintenance works at Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque """,1/17/21 14:05,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122886,"
HEBRON, Sunday, January 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation army today prevented staff of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee (HRC) from conducting maintenance works at the archeological Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, according to the director of the mosque, Hefzi Abu Sneineh.
He told WAFA that Israeli soldiers denied access of the HRC staff to the mosque and ordered a halt on the ordinary maintenance works at the holy site.
Abu Sneineh said the latest Israeli measure was part of a systematic policy aimed at Judaizing the character of the mosque by banning any maintenance works and limiting access of Palestinians to the site, while allowing Jewish fanatics to flock there.
Israeli occupation authorities last week ordered a 10-day ban on the entry of Muslim worshipers to the site under the pretext of the coronavirus restrictions.
The mosque's director told WAFA in a statement last week that Israel's pretext was baseless since all worshipers and visitors have been following up the health and safety protocols of wearing face-masks and social distancing.
Mahmoud al-Habbash, advisor to President Mahmoud Abbas on religious affairs and Islamic relations, had also described Israel's lockdown of the holy site as an inclusive war crime, saying that banning worshipers access to the site could fuel the sentiments of Muslims around the world.
He stressed in a statement last week that the Israeli decision was an interference into the powers of the Palestinian Waqf (Endowments) Department, which is in charge of holy sites in Palestine, as well as a breach of the UNESCO's decision which considers the Ibrahimi Mosque as a pure Islamic site.

He told WAFA that an Israeli army force tore apart and bulldozed the 11 stalls, which belong to citizens from the village, under the pretext of their proximity to the Israeli segregation barrier, which is built on private Palestinian land belonging to citizens of Anin.
Much of the village's private-owned land is already de facto confiscated by the Israeli apartheid barrier, and landowners often need a special Israeli permit to cross the other side of the barrier to reach their land at times of harvest.

NABLUS, Sunday, January 17, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers last night attacked with stones Palestinian vehicles driving at the main Nablus-Ramallah road, just near the village of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, according to local sources.
Colonial settlers from the illegal settlements of Eli and Shilo, built illegally on Palestinian land near the village, gathered at the main street and pelted stones at Palestinian vehicles driving at the road.
The attacks occurred in full sight of Israeli occupation soldiers who did nothing to stop the attack and rather set up two checkpoints and forced Palestinian drivers to use alternative routes.
There has been an increase in settler-related attacks against Palestinians and their properties during the past few week.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

Israeli soldiers reportedly fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters to disperse them, injuring three of them, including a paramedic, by rubber-coated bullets. Many other sustained suffocation from gas inhalation.
All of the injured were treated at the scene of the protest.
Almost every week, Palestinians hold a protest in the village in condemnation of the colonial Israeli settlement enterprise and to demand the occupation authorities to reopen the village's main road, shut down by Israel since 2002.

HEBRON, Saturday, January 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today attacked residents of two Palestinian hamlets in Masafer Yatta complex in the south of the West Bank, according to Fouad al-Amour, a local activist.
He told WAFA that settlers from three illegal settlements attacked the homes of two Palestinian families in Shaab al-Batm and al-Tweimem hamlets.
The residents confronted the settlers and were able to fend them off, he said, explaining that the settlers, under army protection, want to drive the Palestinians out of their homes and lands in order to take them over.

GAZA, Saturday, January 16, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces stationed on the southern border with the Gaza Strip today opened fire at Palestinian farmers working in their lands near the border, forcing them to leave the area, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said that the soldiers at the military watchtowers overlooking the border area east of Khan Yunis fired several rounds at the farmers, who fled the area to avoid being shot.
Israel does not allow Palestinians to reach their lands along the Gaza border with Israel and often infiltrate the borders to either destroy the land and level it or to build dirt mounds causing serious damage to fertile agricultural land in the area that goes more than 300 meters deep into the Gaza Strip.

Thaer Shehadeh, a local citizen, told WAFA that his brother, Awadallah, 35, was standing in front of his home in the village when Israeli soldiers opened live gunshots at him at point blank range, injuring him in the foot and pelvis.
He said the soldiers detained his brother and moved him away by a military ambulance to an unknown destination.

HEBRON, Friday, January 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Several Palestinian and international protesters sustained injuries today as Israeli occupation forces attacked weekly protests against Israeli colonial settlements in the West Bank districts of Hebron and Qalqilia, according to local sources and witnesses.
In Hebron Governorate, south of the West Bank, Israeli occupation soldiers quelled with teargas a nonviolent march organized by hundreds of Palestinian protesters and international solidarity activists in Masafer Yatta locality, injuring at least one woman protester with a gas canister in her foot and detaining an elderly man. Other protesters were even beaten up by the soldiers, while sustained suffocation from gas inhalation. 
The protest was organized in support of the local Palestinian Bedouin communities against a recent surge in Israeli army and settler attacks, as well as in protest of Israeli threats to confiscate large tracts of Palestinian land in the area in favor of the nearby Israeli settlements. 
The protesters waved flags of Palestine and banners condemning the ongoing violations by the Israeli occupation against the Bedouin population of Masafer Yatta.  
Meanwhile, four Palestinians were injured by Israeli occupation forces today during the weekly protest against Israeli settlements in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near the city of Qalqilia in the northern West Bank.
Morad Shtewi, an official in charge of the popular resistance file in the village, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring four of them by rubber-coated rounds. Others also sustained suffocation from gas inhalation.
The injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
For many years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

"Israeli occupation forces seal off locality south of Hebron""",1/15/21 13:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122860,"
HEBRON, Friday, January 15, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today sealed off At-Tuwani locality, south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees in Masafer Yatta Fouad al-‘Amour said that Israeli troops set up barriers at all roads leading to the locality, preventing access into the locality.
The Israeli army imposed the closure in an attempt to deny Palestinians from the surrounding villages and international solidarity activists access into the locality to take part in a rally against frequent army and settler attacks against Palestinians and their property in the area.
Located 14 kilometers south of Hebron, At-Tuwani locality consists of two hamlets, and together with Masafer Yatta, a collection of almost 19 hamlets, cover 37,500 donums, and rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

"Protestor injured as Israeli forces quell anti-settlement protest northeast of Ramallah""",1/15/21 13:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122858,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today quelled an anti-settlement protest in al-Mughayyir village, northeast of Ramallah, injuring a protestor, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli soldiers violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend Ras al-Tin area against being seized to make room for the construction of a new Israeli colonial settlement outpost.
The soldiers opened fire towards the participants as the latter reached al-Qali‘ area, injuring a participants with a rubber-coated steel bullet and causing a number of others to suffer from tear gas.
This came a day after Israeli troops launched a large-scale search and arrest campaign in the town, arresting some 20 young men and posting threatening statements on the houses of the arrested men.
Ayman Abu Alia, whose son, Ali, was killed by Israeli military gunfire in the town in early December, and whom was detained and released several hours afterwards, that he was threatened that his other sons would be killed just like Ali.
Israeli forces shot and killed 15-year-old Ali Abu Alia, hitting him with a live bullet in the abdomen as he participated in the weekly demonstration in al-Mughayyer village on Friday, December 4.
He was standing among the crowds when an Israeli soldier shot him in the abdomen, killing him on his 15th birthday.
Israeli settlers have recently commenced the construction of the new colonial settlement outpost in Ras al-Tin area, and prevented the villagers and shepherds from reaching the area.
Settlers are also attempting to demolish the school in the area, constructed with funding from the European Union, in preparation to force the Palestinian Bedouin community from this area.

"Israel to punitively demolish home of Palestinian prisoner near Jenin""",1/14/21 15:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122853,"
JENIN, Thursday, January 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today notified the family of Mr. Mohammad Mraweh Kabaha, a prisoner in Israeli detention, about their intention to demolish their house in the village of Tura, located southwest of Jenin city in the occupied West Bank, according to Kabaha's family.
Mo'ayyad, Kabaha's brother, said that Israeli occupation army informed them of a court ruling which orders the punitive demolition of their house next week, in retaliation for his brother's alleged killing of a colonial Israeli settler last month.
The house has an area of 180 square meters, and is a shelter for a family of five, including four children.
Israeli occupation authorities have long used to punitively demolish the family homes of Palestinians accused of carrying out attacks on Israelis, a policy that Israel does not apply to Israeli settlers who are involved in fatal attacks against Palestinians.
The policy has been widely condemned by human rights groups as a collective punishment and a war crime.

"PA issues a stark warning of digital economy tardiness because of deprivation of 4G/5G spectrum for Palestine""",1/14/21 13:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122852,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 14, 2021 (WAFA) - The Palestinian Authority (PA) today issued a strong warning that Palestine's momentum towards the digital economy is falling behind due to Israel's control over access to the 4G/5G spectrum.
This continued deprivation of access to the necessary spectrum will have negative economic and social consequences, especially as Covid-19 is transitioning the Palestine society to digital life across key sectors and the current broadband infrastructure is not enough.
In a letter addressed to the international and donor community operating in Palestine, the Palestinian Authority reported the negative impact of such deprivation and the positive results of access to technology.
The letter called for action by the international community and Palestine's development partners in helping to unlock this potential for Palestine to leap into the digital economy by releasing Israel-barred telecommunications spectrum.
Fast-speed mobile Internet, data mining and application development are the backbone of the digital economy and the driving force behind an innovation ecosystem for entrepreneurs and start-ups. The unemployment rate is nearly 50% among university graduates, Palestinian youth are creating their own jobs in remote work and freelance, as well as through technology entrepreneurship and the ""app"" economy.
Today, Palestine has a fragmented map of the telecommunications spectrum. The West Bank uses 3G, which is considered technologically outdated as the world moves to 4G/5G while the Gaza Strip remains stuck with 2G, a technology that does not meet the aspirations of entrepreneurial youth.
At the same time, Israeli operators continue to infringe the area of jurisdiction of Palestinian operators by constantly incurring their market share through illegal and subsidized competition. Most recently, these Israeli operators have been able to market 4G/5G services at very low prices for massive data plans to Palestinian consumers. This infringement of illegal competition is an existential threat to the survival of the Palestinian mobile and fixed-line Internet operators.
According to a World Bank report for 2016, it was estimated that the total revenue loss for telecommunications operators from these intrusions could range from $436 million to $1.1 billion over three years, resulting in a fiscal loss of between $70 million and $184 million for the Palestinian Authority. These numbers could have been doubled by now.
Palestinians have all the capabilities to take advantage of the leapfrog to the digital economy. They have the human talent, they have the know-how, they have a high mobile phone and Internet penetration rate, and there is an evolving eco-system, as such, is poised to make a solid leap into the ""app"" economy if 4G and 5G spectrum are allowed to make that moonshot.
Palestine, like every other nation on earth, must meet its growing demand for broadband to support its new digital era, said the letter.
More than before, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, support for remote work, e-commerce, e-schools, e-health, meeting sustainable development goals and much more. The 4G/5G spectrum is all in dire need to power its digital broadband landscape.
The Palestinian call for action today is threefold: first, the provision of 4G/5G spectrum to Palestinian operators on a non-sharing basis; second, the cessation of Israeli attacks on the telecommunications market through illegal competition; and third, allowing Palestinian operators to work in Area C in the occupied Palestinian territories.

JERUSALEM, Thursday, January 14, 2021 (WAFA) – A Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem today self-demolished his house in Beit Hanina neighborhood to avoid paying high costs and fines after he received a demolition order from the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem, according to the house owner.
Fawaz Abu Hamad, the house owner, said that he proceeded to demolish his house, built 10 years ago and inhabited by seven people, and to remove the rubble to avoid paying exorbitant costs and fines if the West Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition itself.
He said that the demolition, as well as efforts to obtain a building license over the years, have cost him thousands of dollars and in the end, he was forced to tear it down under the pretext it was built without a permit.
Abu Hamad said that in his latest session with the municipality over a permit to his house, he was proposed to pay a fine of $10,000 in return for delaying the demolition for six months, which he did not agree to considering that he spent years paying fines without getting a building permit.

The neighborhoods of Kufr Aqab and the Shufat refugee camp both were illegally annexed and fall within the boundaries of Israel’s Jerusalem municipality, but are located behind Israel’s separation wall.
Israel has not established any COVID-19 vaccination stations to serve the 150,000 residents of Shufat refugee camp, Kufr Aqab, and the surrounding areas.
In a letter addressed to senior figures in the Israeli Health Ministry and a number of Israeli health maintenance organizations (HMOs) charged with administering the COVID-19 vaccines to the public, Adalah Attorney Suhad Bishara called on Israeli health authorities to take immediate action to provide COVID-19 vaccinations for the residents of these two neighborhoods hard hit during the pandemic.
The two neighborhoods suffer from extremely high rates of overcrowding and living conditions conducive to facilitating the spread of the virus. Likewise, both areas suffer from poor infrastructure. In Kufr Aqab, for example, there is no regular water supply; water is a need essential to basic hygiene and to slowing the spread of infection.
The location of both neighborhoods beyond Israel’s separation wall makes it extremely difficult for residents to travel to vaccination centers that have been established inside Jerusalem. Such a journey – which can typically take up to two hours in each direction, involves passing through strictly-controlled Israeli military checkpoints and, for many, travel via crowded public transportation – also increases the risk of infection.
Palestinian women, children, and the elderly are particularly harmed by this series of barriers between Kufr Aqab and Shufat and vaccination centers in Jerusalem.
In addition, Israel tightened its COVID-19 lockdown restrictions for at least two weeks starting last Thursday at midnight, further blocking Palestinian access to Jerusalem.
Given the lack of access to Israeli-administered COVID-19 tests in these two neighborhoods over the past year, Palestinian residents have suffered from a skyrocketing rate of infection and morbidity.
Israel is violating the right to health of Palestinian residents of Jerusalem by failing to provide adequate access to COVID-19 vaccines, said Adalah.

"More than 20 Palestinians rounded up in an Israeli army operation in two Ramallah-area villages""",1/14/21 10:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122846,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 14, 2021 (WAFA) – In an early morning Israeli army raid on two Ramallah-area villages, soldiers rounded up more than 20 Palestinians, according to Palestinian security sources.
They said that soldiers raided the village of al-Mughayyer, northeast of Ramallah, and rounded up at least 16 Palestinians, five of them were later released. The detainees included the father and brother of Ali Abu Alayya, a 13-year-old boy shot and killed by Israeli soldiers in the village in early December.
The soldiers also raided Kufr Malik town, also northeast of Ramallah, and detained six Palestinians, said the sources.
The Palestinian Prisoner Society (PPS) said Israel today detained 41 Palestinians in the occupied territories, mainly in al-Mughayyer and Kufr Malik in the West Bank, and from al-Tur neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, among other places.
It said this is the highest figure of arrests so far this year.

"Israeli settlers continue their rampage against Palestinians in the West Bank with total army apathy""",1/14/21 09:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122844,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 14, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers continued for the second week in a row their rampage against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank with attacks against their properties and on vehicles with Palestinian license plates driving on West Bank roads with total Israeli army apathy, according to officials and witnesses.
Wadi Abu Awwad, mayor of the town of Turmus Ayya, northeast of Ramallah, told WAFA that settlers sneaked into the outskirts of the village during the early morning hours and set two Palestinian-owned vehicles on fire while they smashed the windows of a third.
He said Israeli occupation forces came to the village and took the three cars away, accusing the Israelis of attempting to hide the settlers’ vandalism of Palestinian property.
Settlers also last night attacked Palestinian vehicles commuting on the main Ramallah-Nablus road, near Turmus Ayya, said witnesses.
The settlers threw rocks at the cars damaging many but without causing any bodily harm to their occupants.
Soldiers, who were in the area, did not intervene, said the witnesses.

"Islamic Waqf says Israel's 3D survey of Al-Aqsa Mosque reveals hidden intentions toward the holy site""",1/13/21 18:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122838,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, January 13, 2021 (WAFA) – The Islamic Waqf department in Jerusalem, which is in charge of Muslim holy places, warned today that the 3D survey of Al-Aqsa Mosque compound carried out today by an unidentified group but believed to be Israelis, has with it hidden intentions toward one of Islam's holiest sites.
The Waqf said in a statement that the Israeli occupation authorities gave permission today to an unidentified group that claimed to belong to a foreign company to carry out a three-dimensional survey and imaging of the yards of Al-Aqsa Mosque using advanced scanning and imaging equipment which reveals the occupation's hidden intentions toward Al-Aqsa.
It said Jewish fanatic groups described the surveying as the first step in the construction work for the alleged Jewish temple, which they want to build after destroying the Islamic mosques in the holy compound.
The Waqf said that the Israeli occupation authorities are working day and night in the vicinity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, especially in the Umayyad palaces, and carrying out excavations under the Mosque in an effort to turn it into a Jewish site.
It called on the occupation authorities to refrain from provoking crises and concoct incidents at Al-Aqsa Mosque that encourage the Jewish settlers to violate its sanctity.
It emphasized that all of the walled-in Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound with its yards, mosques and paths, whether they are above or below the ground, are Islamic and will not be divided or shared with any other party.

"Israeli bulldozers raze land, uproot trees near Hebron""",1/13/21 13:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122835,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, January 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Wednesday razed land and uprooted trees to the east of the town of Beit Ummar, north of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.
Mohammad Awad, a local activist, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers escorted bulldozers into al-Qarn area, east of the town, where the heavy machineries leveled about eight donums and uprooted more than 80 trees, including olive trees, belonging to Issam Abu Ayyash.
He added that Abu Ayash was given a permit by the Israeli Supreme Court to cultivate his land, adding that he possesses a title deed, demonstrating his ownership of the land, which is one kilometer away from the Hebron-Jerusalem Street and three kilometers away from the bypass street.
While Israel razes Palestinian land and demolishes structures across the West Bank, particularly in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

NABLUS, Wednesday, January 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli troops and settlers today brutally assaulted two Palestinians in the small village of Khirbet al-Taweel, southeast of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, according to witnesses.
They said that a number of Israeli soldiers and settlers severely beat two Palestinian farmers who were plowing their land in the village, inflicting wounds to their heads. 
The casualties, a father and his son from the nearby town of Majdal Bani Fadil, were rushed to the hospital for urgent treatment.
Israeli settlers began two days ago plowing Palestinian lands in the area, aiming to seizing them eventually.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

"Israeli forces infiltrate Gaza’s border, raze farmland""",1/13/21 11:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122833,"
GAZA, Wednesday, January 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli military vehicles today infiltrated Gaza’s border, to the east of Khan Younis city, and razed farmland, according to WAFA correspondent.
He added that Israeli military tanks and bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of the city in the southern besieged coastal enclave, razed large tracts of farmland near the borderline and erected earth mounds in the area. 
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

They told WAFA that Sanad Rawashda lost his arm after the unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli army during drills exploded near him in the town.
Rawashda was rushed to a hospital for urgent treatment.
The Israeli occupation army usually conducts drills in the southern Hebron, the Jordan Valley and several other parts of the occupied West Bank, and often hand Palestinian families notices ordering them to leave their homes for various periods until the drills are over.
Palestinians living in live-fire training areas have to worry about unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli army after the drills, which have led to the death of many Palestinians, including children, over the past years.

"Israeli forces shoot Palestinian following alleged stabbing attempt in Hebron""",1/13/21 09:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122830,"
 
HEBRON, Wednesday, January 13, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning shot and injured a Palestinian man following an alleged attempted stabbing in the Old City of Hebron, according to security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces opened fire at the young man outside the Hebron’s flashpoint Ibrahimi Mosque, wounding him purportedly for attempting to stab a soldier.
Israeli media claimed the alleged attacker, 22, was hit and moderately wounded in the leg. 
The circumstances surrounding the alleged stabbing attempt remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Israeli has been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Video footage for similar alleged attacks appear to disapprove Israeli military claims, showing alleged Palestinian attackers did not even attempt to carry out any attacks. Some footage showed Israeli forces manipulating the crime scene following such killings.
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

They confirmed that Israeli troops manning the checkpoint rounded up a Palestinian, who was not identified, purportedly for attempting to stab a soldier.
Israeli media claimed that the assailant, a 51-year-old resident of Nablus, tried to cross into the occupied city of Jerusalem and Israel without having the appropriate work permit. 
When he was denied entry, he “began to act recklessly, pulled out a screwdriver and “most likely” tried to stab one of the guards with it,” according to the Israeli police spokesman.
Israeli soldiers, according to the statement, “were able to neutralize the suspect without opening fire” and eventually took him to custody for interrogation. 
The circumstances surrounding the alleged stabbing attempt remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Israeli has been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Video footage for similar alleged attacks appear to disapprove Israeli military claims, showing alleged Palestinian attackers did not even attempt to carry out any attacks. Some footage showed Israeli forces manipulating the crime scene following such killings.
Originally built as a roadblock in 2001, Qalandia checkpoint was expanded and become the busiest checkpoint in the West Bank in terms of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. It has a strong military presence and is often the scene of confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinians.

"Presidential Committee for Churches condemns attack on Jerusalem convent""",1/12/21 18:41,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122823,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, January 12, 2021 (WAFA) – The Presidential Committee for Churches’ Affairs today condemned an attack on a Catholic convent in the occupied city of Jerusalem.
Chairman of the Committee Ramzi Khoury, who also serves as the Chairman of the Palestinian National Fund, decried in a press statement the attack and attempted robbery against Home Notre Dame Des Douleurs, which serves as a care home for the elderly and disabled established by the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem and located on the road from Gethsemani Convent to Jericho.
“This is not the first attack against Muslim and Christian places of worship and holy sites, particularly in Jerusalem. The ]Israeli[ occupation ]authorities[ bear full responsibility for all attacks against houses of worship as it they are the de facto power there,” Khoury said in the statement.  
He stressed that the attack was the “result of inaction on the part of the ]Israeli[ occupation authorities as well as the lack of deterrent against all previous occurrences that violated the sanctity of our holy places, but were always excused as committed by mentally deranged people.”
He noted that such attacks are a part of the Israeli government and settlers’ attempts to pressurize the Palestinian people, including Christians, into leaving their homeland, and called on churches worldwide to take decisive decisions and actions against the Israeli occupation injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people.
The assailants stole the tabernacle, an ornately decorated box that houses the Eucharist, but they threw it away in the garden when they discovered it was not made of a precious metal. 
The care home was inaugurated by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Alberto Gori in 1957, and currently provides care to 45 elderly people.

HEBRON, Tuesday, January 12, 2021 (WAFA) - Armed Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian family in Hebron's town of Beit Ummar and uprooted dozens of their fully-grown trees, according to a local activist.

Local activist, Mohammed Awad, told WAFA a group of armed settlers from the Israeli settlement of Karmei Tzur, built illegally on Beit Ummar land, backed by Israeli army forces, uprooted dozens of fully-grown almond trees and grapevines belonging to local resident Mohammed Abu Snaineh.

Settlers further assaulted and threatened Abu Snaineh and his family at gunpoint and prevented them from entering their land.

According to the Israeli information center for human rights in occupied territories, B'Tselem: ""Settler violence has long since become part of Palestinians’ daily life under occupation. Israeli security forces enable these actions, which result in Palestinians casualties – injuries and fatalities – as well as damage to land and property.""

""In some cases, they even serve as an armed escort or even join in the attacks. Investigations, if even opened, are usually closed with no action taken against perpetrators as part of an undeclared policy of leniency,"" added B'Tselem.

""The long-term effect of this violence is the dispossession of Palestinians from increasing parts of the West Bank, making it easier for Israel to take over land and resources,"" said the center.

RAMALLAH, Tuesday, January 12, 2021 (WAFA) – The Palestinian Ministry of Culture condemned today a ban by an Israeli court on playing the film ""Jenin Jenin"" by the artist Mohammad Bakri and the heavy fine imposed on him.
The Israeli District Court in Lydda in central Israel yesterday banned playing the film in Israel and ordered Bakri, the film director, to pay 175,000 Israeli shekels ($55,000) in damages to an Israeli soldier who appeared in the film that documented the Israeli army massacre in Jenin during the April 2002 military incursion of that northern West Bank city that left dozens of Palestinians dead and most of the city’s refugee camp levelled to the ground.
The court also ordered Bakri, who said he will appeal the ruling at the Israeli High Court, to pay an additional 50,000 shekels ($15,000) in legal expenses.
Palestinian Minister of Culture Atef Abu Seif said in a statement that the court ruling is an attempt to prevent the truth to be told about what happened in Jenin at that time.
""The Israeli occupation authorities are afraid to see the facts that expose its brutality and the suffering of the Palestinian people presented to the world,"" he said.
""This ban is an attempt to suppress the truth and obscure the true face of the occupation and its racist and fascist practices,"" said Abu Seif, denouncing Israel’s attempts to fight the Palestinian narrative and the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and independence.

"In a collective punishment move, entrances to Ramallah-district village remain sealed by Israel for fifth day""",1/11/21 12:02,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122796,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, January 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Two main entrances to al-Mughayyir village, northeast of Ramallah city, remain sealed off by Israeli occupation forces for the fifth consecutive day making movement of residents in and out of the village very difficult, according to an official.
Mayor of al-Mughayyir, Amin Abu Alia, told WAFA that the Israeli forces closed the entrances of the village using earth mounds and cement blocks, preventing the villagers from entering and leaving it and forcing them to take long detours to reach their workplaces.
Two days earlier, scores of the villagers suffocated from tear gas as Israeli forces cracked on a rally against the ongoing closure.
The village has become the scene of weekly protests against the Israeli occupation authorities’ plan to seize lands in Ras al-Tin area to make room for the construction of a new Israeli colonial settlement outpost, with ensuing confrontations leading to injuries.
Israeli settlers have recently commenced the construction of a new colonial settlement outpost in Ras al-Tin area and prevented the villagers and shepherds from reaching the area.
On December 4, 14-year-old Ali Abu Alia died of his wounds sustained from Israeli military gunfire during clashes between Israeli soldiers and protestors in the village.

"Palestinian workers shot and injured by Israeli gunfire near the apartheid barrier north of the West Bank""",1/11/21 10:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122795,"
TULKARM, Monday, January 11, 2021 (WAFA) – Six Palestinian workers attempting to reach their workplaces inside Israel were shot and injured this morning by Israeli army gunfire at a gate in the apartheid barrier separating the West Bank from Israel near the village of Faroun, south of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm, according to local sources and the Ministry of Health.
The Ministry said that six Palestinians were brought to hospital in Tulkarm with gun wounds to the leg. Their injuries were reported to be light, but the hospital director said two of the injuries suffer from broken bones and need medical attention.
Local sources said the soldiers opened fire at the workers near the gate where they gathered in an effort to cross the barrier and reach their workplaces inside Israel, injuring six, all said to be in their 20s.
Israel started building the barrier, most of it a concrete wall, in 2002 to separate the West Bank from Israel even though a large part of it was built deep inside the occupied territories and on Palestinian agricultural land.
In 2003, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that stated the wall contradicts international law and should be removed. The International Court of Justice also issued in July 2004 an advisory opinion stating that the barrier is a violation of international law and should be removed.

"Settlers uproot, steal olive saplings south of Nablus""",1/10/21 11:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122789,"
NABLUS, Sunday, January 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Hardcore Israeli settlers today uprooted and stole scores of olive saplings in the village of Qusra, to the south of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, a local official who monitors settlements activity in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers from a nearby illegal settlement sneaked their way into the eastern part of the village, where they uprooted and stole 130 olive saplings.
The saplings belong to four Palestinian landowners from Qusra.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Over 700,000 Israeli settlers live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, January 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Hundreds of Israelis resumed their weekly demonstrations last night against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for the long-serving Israeli leader to resign over corruption charges and mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Protesters held signs reading “Go,” and “Bibi, let my people go,” calling on Netanyahu to step down.
The protest in Paris Square in occupied Jerusalem near Netanyahu’s official residence came as Israel was entering a third national lockdown imposed against the backdrop of a surging coronavirus outbreak.
The months-long protests began last spring when Netanyahu and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to form what they called an emergency government focused on managing the health and economic challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Their partnership has been paralyzed by infighting, and a pair of lockdowns hit the economy hard, sending unemployment skyrocketing to double-digit figures.
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial was scheduled to resume this week, but was postponed indefinitely amid the tighter restrictions.

NABLUS, Sunday, January 10, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinian villagers and residents of the village of Burqa, north of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, yesterday fended off an attack by hardcore Israeli settlers which targeted the village, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli settlement activities in the area, said a group of settlers who were performing a provocative tour of the area attempted to attack the village, but were confronted by local residents who forced them to leave.
Meanwhile, Daghlas said other groups of settlers attacked with stones several Palestinian vehicles passing at Nablus-Ramallah and Qalqilia-Nablus roads, but said no injuries were reported.
Settler violence is commonplace across the occupied West Bank, and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities as the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction over Israeli settlers.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

RAMALLAH, Friday, January 08, 2021 (WAFA) – An elderly and a paramedic were injured today when Israeli occupation forces assaulted hundreds of protesters taking part in nonviolent popular resistance events in the area of Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, and in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near Qalqilia, according to witnesses.
In Msafer Yatta, Israeli occupation soldiers attacked hundreds of activists taking part in a protest against the daily Israeli army and settler-related attacks on defenseless Palestinian communities in Msafer Yatta, and against the Israeli ethnic cleansing of the area's Palestinian population. 
An elderly was injured after being run over by Israeli soldiers, while other protesters suffocated from gas inhalation. The elderly, Haj Suleiman Hathalin, was moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
Foad Omour, a local anti-settlements activist, told WAFA that the Israeli occupation authorities have doubled their attacks on Palestinian civilians in the area and their property in an effort to push them out of the area in favor of the Israeli colonial settlement project.
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers attacked the weekly protest against Israeli settlements in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near Qalqilia, injuring two Palestinians, including a paramedic. The two were treated at the scene.

NABLUS, Friday, January 08, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today attacked hundreds of Palestinian protesters taking part in the weekly nonviolent anti-settlements protests that have been taking place in the villages of Beit Dajan and Deir Jarir, witnesses told WAFA.
Hundreds of protesters were taking part in a rally following the weekly Friday prayers in Beit Dajan in protest of Israel's confiscation of large swathes of Palestinian land for the benefit of a colonial settlement outpost near the village.
The protesters were met with brutal force, and Israeli soldiers fired teargas canisters and stun grenades to disperse the protest causing many cases of suffocation from teargas inhalation. The injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
The area has been witnessing weekly protests over the past two months against Israel's ongoing theft of Palestinian land for the benefit of the colonial Israeli settlement construction and expansion.
Meanwhile, several Palestinian protesters sustained suffocation from teargas when Israeli occupation forces assaulted hundreds of protesters taking part in the weekly nonviolent protest in the village of Deir Jarir, northeast of Ramallah, against Israel's plan to build a new settlement outpost in the area.
Ayman Alawi, mayor of the village, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets and teargas canisters at the protesters to disperse them, causing many cases of suffocation from teargas inhalation.
Two weeks ago, Israeli settlers set up a tent and embarked on digging and construction works in the area in a prelude to establish a new colonial settlement outpost on Palestinian land.
The village has been a frequent target of recurrent attacks by Israeli occupation forces and colonial settlers over the past few months.

Mohammad Yousef Abu Aram, 16 year old, was moved to hospital after he was injured in the explosion of the ordnance left behind the Israeli occupation army in the area.
The Israeli occupation army usually conducts drills in the occupied West Bank, and Palestinian families often receive notices ordering them to leave their homes for various periods until the drills are over.
Palestinians living in live fire training areas have to worry about unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli army after the drills, which have led to the death of many Palestinians, including children, over the past years.

"Officials condemn Israel's lockdown of Ibrahimi Mosque for 10 days""",1/8/21 09:53,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122769,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, January 08, 2021 (WAFA) – Palestinian officials have condemned the decision of the Israeli occupation authorities to shut down the archaeological Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, for 10 days under the pretext of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hefzi Abu Sneineh, the director of the mosque, told WAFA that Israel's order will ban the entry of worshipers and visitors to the holy site for ten days under the pretext of the coronavirus restrictions.
He said Israel's pretext was baseless since all worshipers and visitors have been following up the health and safety protocols of wearing face-masks and social distancing.
Meanwhile, Mahmoud al-Habbash, advisor to President Mahmoud Abbas on religious affairs and Islamic relations, described Israel's lockdown of the holy site as an inclusive war crime, saying that banning worshipers access to the site could fuel the sentiments of Muslims around the world.
He said the Israeli decision was also an interference into the powers of the Palestinian Waqf (Endowments) Department, which is in charge of holy sites in Palestine, as well as a breach of the UNESCO's decision which considers the Ibrahimi Mosque as a pure Islamic site.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs described the Israeli move as a breach of the Palestinian sovereignty over the holy site that is aimed at transferring sovereignty there to the Israeli occupation authorities. 
Husam Abul-Rob, Undersecretary of the Ministry, said the Ministry views the Israeli decision with suspicion since it comes in the aftermath of a series of Israeli violations against holy sites in Palestine, the latest of which was allowing Israeli fanatics escorted by army to perform a provocative tour of the Nabi Musa Mosque at Jerusalem-Jericho road.

"Occupation army locks down entrances to Ramallah village """,1/7/21 13:06,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122766,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 07, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation army locked down today the entrances to the village of Al-Mughayir, to the northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, local sources said.
Soldiers shut down the entrances to the village banning entry and exit of local Palestinians to and out of the village, and forcing them to use alternative routes to enter or leave the village.
The village has been a frequent target of recurrent attacks by the Israeli occupation forces and colonial settlers, with much of the village's land facing a threat of confiscation in favor of the colonial settlement project.
In the meantime, Israeli occupation forces dismantled eight Palestinian-owned residential shacks near the village of Beit Iksa, to the northwest of Jerusalem, under the pretext of lacking an Israeli permit.

RAMALLAH, Thursday, January 07, 2021 /WAFA/ – At least three Palestinians were injured today in attack by hardcore Israeli settles in the village of Kafr Malik, to the east of Ramallah city in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Illegal hardcore settlers, protected by an Israeli army unit, attacked with stones and beat up Palestinian farmers who were plowing their land in the village, injuring three of them. The three were moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
The land where the attack occurred has been facing an imminent threat of confiscation by the Israeli occupation authorities for the benefit of the colonial settlement enterprise.
As a matter of fact, settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

NABLUS, Wednesday, January 06, 2021 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers today uprooted and stole scores of olive saplings in Jalud village, south of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, a local official who monitors settlements activity in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers sneaked their way into the southern part of the village, where they uprooted and stole 150 olive saplings.
The landowner was identified as Mohamoud Fawzi Mohammad.
Earlier today, Israeli forces uprooted over a thousand olive saplings and trees in Deir Ballut town, west of the northern West Bank city of Salfit.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Over 700,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

"Israeli forces uproot olive saplings west of Salfit """,1/6/21 11:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122747,"
SALFIT, Wednesday, January 6, 2021 (WAFA) – Israel forces today uprooted over a thousand olive saplings and trees in Deir Ballut town, west of the northern West Bank city of Salfit, according to eyewitness.
They told WAFA that Israeli forces sealed off the western part of the town, known as Khallet al-Abhar, and escorted a bulldozer to it, before the heavy machine destroyed over a thousand olive trees and saplings belonging to local Palestinian farmers.
Located 15 kilometers to the west of Salfit city, Deir Ballut has a population of some 4,100 and occupied a total area of 11,900 dunams. It boasts several archeological sites dating back to the Byzantine era, such as St. Simeon Monastery and al-Qal‘a Monastery. 
Before 1948, the village owned 40,000 dunums of land (10,000 acres). In 1967, 20% of the land of Deir Ballut (or 2,000 acres) was confiscated into Israel. Since then, like so many other villages in Palestine, Deir Ballut has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying 621 dunams, accounting for almost 5 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, which encircles the village from three directions, confiscating and isolating some 4,050 dunams of fertile land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
Israel has established two colonial settlements, namely Alei Zahav and Pedu’el, on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated more land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road 446, which extends two kilometers on the village’s land.
The Israeli “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israeli occupation forces halt work on an agricultural road in northern Jordan Valley""",1/5/21 11:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122734,"
TUBAS, Tuesday, January 05, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today halted work on an agricultural road to the east of Tayasir village, east of Tubas city in the northern Jordan Valley, according to a local activist.
Mutaz Bisharat, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli colonial activities in the Jordan Valley, said that Israeli soldiers stormed the area east of the village and impounded a bulldozer belonging to a contractor who was laying the groundwork for a new agricultural road funded by the Ministry of Local Government.
Israeli occupation forces often impound excavators involved in the construction of new roads in the occupied Jordan Valley, which Israel said before that it intends to annex despite international outcry and therefore prevents Palestinians from developing it.

JERUSALEM, Monday, January 04, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers tonight attacked Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and blocked roads, according to witnesses.
They told WAFA that the settlers blocked with burning tires a main road in an area known as al-Musrara, just outside Damascus Gate, one of the main gates to the old city, before attacking cars of Palestinians with stones.
Damage was caused to cars, but no reports of injuries, they said.
Rampage by Israelis against Palestinians in the occupied territories has been on the rise in the past weeks as the Israeli occupation authorities fail to put a stop to these attacks.

RAMALLAH, Monday, January 04, 2021 (WAFA) – As part of its collective punishment policy, Israel today destroyed a large area of agricultural land in the village of Deir Nitham, northwest of Ramallah, as the army continued to impose a tight blockade on the village, according to a local activist.
The Israeli measures against the entire village came to punish its residents after an Israeli settler was injured three days ago by a stone thrown at her car while driving by the village on her way to her illegal settlement.
Local activist Mujahed Tamimi told WAFA that army bulldozers razed and destroyed a large area of land at the entrance to the village apparently to build a permanent army watchtower.
For the last two days, the Israeli army has terrorized the entire village residents with raids of their homes in the middle of the night, detaining people at random, and assaulting some. Three village youngsters, all age 19, were detained and taken to an unknown location.
The army has also imposed a tight blockade on the village and prevented its people from entering or leaving it, including students and teachers heading to their schools.

JERUSALEM, Monday, January 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers today demolished a number of Palestinian-owned structures in Anata town, northeast of the occupied city of Jerusalem, according to an official.
Mayor of Anata, Taha al-Rifa‘e, said that Israeli forces and staff of the so-called Jerusalem Municipality escorted bulldozers into the eastern section of the town, close to the industrial zone, where the heavy machineries tore down four structures and walls, besides to several houses al-Najma neighborhood of the town.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
Rights groups have long pointed out that Israel’s discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem – which include routine home demolitions, discriminatory allocation of building permits, and the eviction of Palestinians from their homes for the benefit of Israeli settlers – are aimed at driving out Palestinians from the city.

"Israeli forces blockade Ramallah-district village for second consecutive day""",1/4/21 14:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122723,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, January 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today continued to blockade Deir Nidham village, northwest of Ramallah city, for the second consecutive day, according to security sources.
They confirmed that the Israeli army sealed off the village purportedly as part of an active pursuit of the perpetrators of a stone-throwing attack near the village.
An Israeli female settler was seriously injured after being pelted with stones as she was driving past the entrance of the village and near the Israeli colonial settlement of Neve Tzuf, also known as Halamish. 
Israeli forces Sunday evening heavily deployed in and around the village, launching a massive house-to-house search campaign and detaining 20 villagers on suspicion of being involved in the attack and assaulting others.
Soldiers and intelligence officers set up a tent at the entrance of the village, where they interrogated dozens villagers, and conducted field investigations in the streets of the village.
Security sources confirmed that 16 of the detainees were released last night, while the four others remain in detention. 
Following the stone-throwing incident, Israeli military bulldozers destroyed a swimming pool belonging to the villagers on the side of the bypass Road 465, which was constructed at the expense of the villagers’ lands.
Located 14 kilometers to the northwest of Ramallah city, Deit Nidham, also written as Deit Nizzam, has a population of some 1,000 and occupies a total area of 2,758 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a very small pocket of 130 donums, classified as Area B and accounting for 4.7 percent of the village land.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has seized at least 22 percent of the village’s land for the construction of the nearby colonial settlement of Neve Tzuf. It has confiscated more land for the construction of settler-only by-pass Road 465, which extends 7.4 kilometers on the village’s land, which connects the settlements with one another and encloses the village from four directions.

They confirmed that several an Israeli military force barged its way into the camp in the early morning hours and sealed off the main entrance of the camp, triggering confrontations.
The soldiers opened fire towards protestors, injuring two with live fire and another with a rubber-coated steel bullet and causing dozens to suffocate from tear gas.
The casualties were rushed to a hospital for urgent treatment, whereas the suffocation cases were treated at the scene.
The raid resulted in the detention of one Palestinian.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

JORDAN VALLEY, Monday, January 4, 2021 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today razed Palestinian farmlands in Khirbet al-Farisiya in the northern Jordan Valley, according to a local activist.
Aref Daraghmeh, a local human rights activist, told WAFA that settlers escorted bulldozers into al-Farisiya, where the heavy machineries leveled large tract of farmlands belonging to the villagers as a prelude to seize them and set up colonial agricultural enterprises. 
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

He pointed that the settlers were attempting to temper with the agricultural land and uproot trees as part of their attempts to set up a new colonial settlement outpost.

JORDAN VALLEY, Sunday, January 03, 2021 (WAFA) – Colonial Israeli settlers last night attacked Palestinian herders in the northern Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, said Muataz Bsharat, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli settlements in the area.
He said the settlers from the so-called Hilltop Youth terror group assaulted the herders while holding a night vigil in the area and forced them to leave. No injuries were reported.
Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians are commonplace, but assaults on defenseless Palestinian communities across the West Bank, including on farmers and herders, have been frequent over the past few weeks. Most of these attacks occured in the presence of the Israeli occupation army, which did nothing to stop the attacks and rather provided protection for assailants.
Armed settlers and soldiers often prevent Palestinian shepherds from herding in the open pastures of the occupied West Bank in order to force them to abandon the area.

Fanatic settlers gathered at the main Nablus-Ramallah street near the village of Huwwara, south of the city, and attacked with stones Palestinian vehicles driving at the road. No injuries were reported.

Ibrahim Awadallah, a local activist, told WAFA that an Israeli occupation army force broke into the village and handed a notification ordering takeover of a plot belonging to the heirs of two local Palestinian citizens, under the pretext that the plot was an ""absentee's property"".
Awadallah said the notification orders the heirs of the land owners to leave the property no later than 45 days from today.
He added that the current owners of the plot, which is mainly planted with olives, have proper paperwork proving their ownership of by means of inheritance.
According to Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the Israeli Absentees' Property Law has been a main legal instrument used by Israel to take possession of the land belonging to the internal and external Palestinian refugees, as well as Muslim Waqf properties.
Under this law, Palestinian refugees and the internally displaced are regarded as “present absentees”, a designation that authorizes the unfair confiscation of their land.

"Rights groups to High Court: Palestinian prisoners must have phone contact with their families during COVID-19""",12/31/20 13:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122675,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, December 31, 2020 (WAFA) - HaMoked: Center for the Defense of the Individual and seven other human rights organizations petitioned Israel’s High Court demanding that incarcerated Palestinians defined as ""security"" prisoners and detainees be allowed to maintain telephone contact with their families during the COVID-19 pandemic, today said a press release.
The petition comes in light of the prolonged isolation of thousands of people from their families following the cancellation of all prison visits due to Coronavirus restrictions. The petition is joined by the organizations Addameer, al-Mezan, Physicians for Human Rights Israel, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Public Committee Against Torture, Adalah and Parents Against Child Detention.
The petition was filed as Israel entered its third lockdown and all prison visits were suspended indefinitely. While criminal prisoners have access to daily phone calls with their families, the majority of Palestinians are defined as ""security"" prisoners or detainees, and as such are denied phone calls by the Israel Prison Service /IPS/.
The petition details how, since the outbreak of the pandemic in late February, the IPS has restricted visits to its facilities, leaving the over 4,000 Palestinian prisoners and inmates completely cut off from the outside world. Among the cases described is that of a prisoner in Shatta Prison who, without visits or phone calls, learned through radio broadcasts that his sister was pregnant, that one of his grandmothers had contracted COVID-19 and his other grandmother’s health had deteriorated.
The petition also demands access to phone calls for detainees who have contracted the Coronavirus or need to quarantine due to contact with confirmed patients. This demand is based on testimonies given to the organizations by prisoners who were sick or in quarantine for weeks but were not allowed to phone their families to tell them of their condition. Families of prisoners and detainees gave similar testimonies, also noting that the IPS did not even inform them of their loved one’s health condition while they were isolated in prison Coronavirus quarantine.
In addition, the petition demands that a system be put in place to grant all detained minors frequent access to phone calls, similarly to the pilot program currently in effect in the Damon prison. This demand comes months after the IPS committed, as part of previous legal proceedings by the organizations, to allow minors to speak with their families once every two weeks throughout the Coronavirus crisis. Yet despite this promise, minors in prisons other than Damon have not had regular phone calls with their parents for the past several months.
Jessica Montell, Executive Director of HaMoked, said: ""Ten months into this pandemic and the Israel Prison Service has failed to ensure regular contact between Palestinian detainees and prisoners and their families. Now, with the third lockdown and the cancellation of all prison visits, thousands of people are completely cut off from the outside world. At this time of heightened uncertainty, where we’re all worried about the spread of the Coronavirus, families of prisoners have no way of knowing their loved one’s condition, and prisoners have no way of knowing how the pandemic is affecting those back home. Keeping prisoners in these circumstances is a violation of their rights to family life and to humane treatment.""

"After holding it for 10 months, Israel turns over body of slain Palestinian to his family for burial""",12/31/20 11:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122672,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, December 31, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today turned over the body of slain Palestinian Maher Zaatra after being withheld for almost 10 months, according to local sources.
Zaatra’s body was released by the Israeli military very early today and handed over to a limited number of his family in order to be buried in his East Jerusalem’s Jabal al-Mukabber neighborhood under very strict Israeli restrictions and high presence of its forces.
Zaatra, 33, was shot by Israeli forces on February 22 after he allegedly attempted to stab an Israeli policeman near Bab al–Asbat /Lions Gate/ in occupied Jerusalem, causing him a serious injury that led to his death later.
Dozens of Palestinians killed by Israeli occupation forces are withheld despite calls by human rights groups on Israel to release them. Israel said it will use the bodies as a bargaining chip in any future exchange deal with the Palestinians.

"Five Palestinians, most of them former prisoners, detained by Israel in Ramallah city and area villages""",12/30/20 14:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122666,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, December 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today detained five Palestinians, most of them former prisoners, from Ramallah and al-Bireh district, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society (PPS).
It said in a press release that Israeli forces brutally assaulted and re-arrested Rami Fadayel, 40, a former prisoner, after ransacking his house in the Ramallah neighborhood of al-Tireh.
Fadayel, father of a child, was released last week after spending two years in administrative detention in Israel without charge or trial. He was detained again last night, then released a few hours later, to be re-detained early today.
Israeli soldiers re-detained two other former prisoners and seized the car of one of them after storming their family homes in the Ramallah city neighborhoods of Ein Minjed and Ein Misbah.
PPS also said an Israeli military force raided Abu Qash village, north of Ramallah, resulting in the detention of one Palestinian.
Soldiers also conducted a raid into Ein Qiniya village, northwest of Ramallah, where they detained another.
This came just a day after Israeli forces carried out large-scale detention raids across Ramallah district, searching many homes and detaining some 15 Palestinians, most of them former political prisoners.
Meanwhile, local sources said Israeli forces detained two other Palestinians, including a former prisoner who was released in 2015, while they were inside Israel. Both detainees were identified as residents of Silat al-Harithiya village, northwest of Jenin.

RAMALLAH, Wednesday, December 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday night attacked Palestinian vehicles in the occupied West Bank districts of Nablus and Bethlehem, according to local sources.
In Nablus district, armed Israeli settlers closed off the main street in the village of Huwwara, south of Nablus, and threw rocks at vehicles.
Another group of settlers targeted Palestinian vehicles to the north and west of Nablus city.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that settlers hurled rocks at Palestinian vehicles travelling between Nablus and Tulkarem cities to the west of Deir Sharaf village, west of Nablus, damaging some of them.
He confirmed similar stone-throwing attacks against Palestinian vehicles near al-Naqoura village, north of Nablus, causing damages to some of them.
No human casualties were reported, whatsoever.
Meanwhile, local sources said that Israeli forces provided protection for Israeli settlers as they gathered near the junction of the Gush Etzion settlement bloc as well as the village of al-Fardis, south and east of Bethlehem.
Settlers held the Israeli flags and slogans as well.
The Israeli occupation authorities have constructed a complex network of settler-only bypass roads that stretch hundreds of kilometers from the north to the south of the West Bank, seizing large tracts of land in order to link Israeli colonial settlements with each other, impeding Palestinian territorial continuity, and enabling further Israeli control over Palestinian territory.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

"Israeli forces order halt on house construction south of Bethlehem""",12/29/20 19:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122656,"
BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, December 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today ordered a halt on the construction of a house in al-Khader town, south of Bethlehem, according to a local activist.
Mohammad Salah said that an Israeli military force barged their way into the western part of the town, where they handed Ali Mousa a military a notice, ordering him to stop the construction of his house, purportedly for being built without a license.
This is the fourth time for Mousa to embark on the construction of a house. His house was demolished three times.
Located 4 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem city, al-Khader has a population of some 12,500 and occupies a total area of 8,280 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying some 1,200 dunams, accounting for almost 14.5 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Since the start of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, like so many other villages in Palestine, al-Khader has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Israel has constructed Efrat and Neve Daniyyel colonial settlements on an area of 6,329 dunums of Palestinian land, including a portion confiscated from al-Khader. It has also constructed a section of the apartheid wall, isolating some 5,620 dunums of the town’s land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
It has confiscated more land for the construction of a tunnel and a crossing, controlling Palestinian movement from Bethlehem city and the western countryside villages.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

JENIN, Tuesday, December 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today issued a notice of demolition against a greenhouse to the west of the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, according to local sources.
They told WAFA that Israeli soldiers handed Rushdi al-Kilani, an agronomist from al-Sila al-Harithiya town, a notice of demolition against his greenhouse in Khirbet al-Hafira area, to the west of Jenin, under the pretext that they area is an archaeological area.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
The demolition of Palestinian property by the Israeli authorities has led to the transfer of families and whole communities in violation of international law. Furthermore, the destruction of property unless it is absolutely necessary for military operations is prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention. Both forcible transfer and the destruction of property not required by military necessity constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and are listed as war crimes by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, December 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers have been active since early this morning in fencing a large tract of Palestinian land in the northern Jordan Valley in a bid to eventually steal it and claim ownership, according to a local rights activist.
Aref Daraghme, a human rights defender, said the settlers were fencing land east of Khillet Makhoul village.
The settlers, with the consent and support of the occupation army, have been active this year in fencing Palestinian land in the Jordan Valley to prevent landowners and farmers from reaching their lands and to eventually take them over.
Israel said it intends to annex the occupied Jordan Valley, a third of the area of the West Bank, a decision that has provoked worldwide condemnation, and therefore works to keep its Palestinian population to a bare minimum while denying them the right to develop their lands and benefit from them.

"Israeli minister blocks COVID-19 vaccinations for Palestinian prisoners; demand to overturn decision""",12/28/20 15:47,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122638,"
HAIFA, Monday, December 28, 2020 (WAFA) – In light of the Israeli Public Security Minister Amir Ohana directive preventing Palestinians detained by Israel from receiving vaccinations, in violation of mandatory Health Ministry guidelines, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel sent an urgent letter to senior Israeli officials late yesterday demanding they act to immediately reverse the decision to block Palestinians designated by Israel as ""security prisoners"" from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
Adalah General Director Attorney Hassan Jabareen sent a letter to Ohana and Israel Prison Service /IPS/ Chargé d'Affairs Asher Vaknin demanding that they move to revoke Ohana’s decision to prevent Palestinian prisoners from being vaccinated.
Jabareen also called on Israel to refrain from infringing upon the health and human rights of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli facilities, as authorities have been doing on a consistent basis since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.
Ohana had ordered the vaccination of Israeli prison workers only.
When Israeli lawmaker Moshe Arbel queried Ohana about state violations of the rights of all those being held prisoner by Israel, Ohana clarified that his directives were to block vaccinations from ""security prisoners"" – which is how Israel refers to Palestinian prisoners.
Israel’s Health Ministry had earlier sent a letter to the Public Security Ministry directing that vaccinations must be provided to those in high-risk groups and to individuals over the age of 60, specifying that the IPS must vaccinate prisoners under its care in accordance with these standards.
Adalah stressed that the Israeli Public Security Ministry’s directive to exclude Palestinian ""security prisoners"" from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine constitutes a violation of the prisoners' health and medical rights and, similarly, violates Israeli Health Ministry instructions as well as professional medical ethics which guarantee equal treatment for all.
The letter further emphasized that it should not be necessary to remind the Public Security Ministry and the IPS of its mandated responsibility to protect the lives and health of prisoners in accordance with Israel’s Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom, which states that ""All persons are entitled to protection of their life, body and dignity."" Article 11 of the same law specifies that ""All governmental authorities are bound to respect the rights under this Basic Law"".
In addition, international law and human rights treaties signed by Israel obligate its state authorities to provide medical care for prisoners.
Adalah General Director Hassan Jabareen commented: ""Israeli Public Security Minister Amir Ohana’s decision to exclude Palestinian prisoners from receiving COVID-19 vaccinations is racist. This is a violation of prisoners’ basic and medical rights and of international laws and conventions which Israel is obligated to uphold.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time Israeli authorities have violated the medical and human rights of prisoners during the COVID-19 outbreak."" M.K.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, December 27, 2020 (WAFA) – A pregnant woman and a paramedic were injured early today morning as Israeli occupation forces raided the courtyards of the Palestine Medical Complex in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, according to medical sources and witnesses.
Israeli soldiers broke into the courtyards of the Complex, fired teargas canisters and rubber-coated rounds randomly at medical staff and patients, injuring a pregnant woman by a rubber-coated round in her shoulder and a paramedic in his arm. 
Others sustained suffocation from gas inhalation, while some patients were terrified as a result of the assault. An ambulance also sustained partial damage from the Israeli firing. 
Minister of Health Mai Alkaila condemned the attack, which she said posed a threat to the patients receiving treatment at the hospital, especially patients of COVID-19 and children, due to the intensity of the teargas fired by the occupation forces.
She described the attack as a grave breach of the sanctity of the hospital which requires immediate international intervention and holding the occupying state to account for its breach of international humanitarian law.
Alkaila pointed out that this was the second attack by Israeli occupation forces on hospitals in Palestine, the first of which was the attack by Israeli warplanes on the Al-Durra Hospital in the Gaza Strip on Friday-Saturday night, which resulted in minor injuries among children receiving treatment at the hospital.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, December 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Despite freezing weather, hundreds of Israelis demonstrated for the 27th week last night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem demanding him to step down over long-running corruption charges.
Hundreds took part in a march from the city’s main entrance to Paris Square, the main site of the demonstrations.
Protesters reportedly held slogans urging Netanyahu to “Go,” and declaring that “We won’t stop protesting until you get out of our lives,” as reported by Israeli media outlets. 
Smaller protests also took place in many areas of the country, including near the prime minister’s private home in Caesarea and at plazas, junctions and highway overpasses.
Several incidents of violence toward protesters were reported by Israeli dailies. In Rishon Lezion a man threatened demonstrators with a knife. In Giv’at Ada, near Caesarea, protesters said they were assaulted by several supporters of the prime minister. 
The months-long protests began last spring when Netanyahu and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to form what they called an emergency government focused on managing the health and economic challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Their partnership has been paralyzed by infighting, and a pair of lockdowns hit the economy hard, sending unemployment skyrocketing.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, December 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Hundreds of Israeli settlers last night attacked homes of Palestinian citizens and terrorized them in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied Jerusalem, according to witnesses.
Settlers, protected by Israeli police, gathered at Road 1 in Sheikh Jarrah and attacked homes, vehicles and passers-by, while the police did nothing to stop them. 
In the meantime, Israeli settlers attacked with stones Palestinian vehicles passing at Route 60 near the village of Sinjil, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
No casualties were reported in the two incidents.
Israeli settlers have escalated their attacks against Palestinian civilians across the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem since last week. 
Some of the terrorist attacks saw settlers pelt stones at vehicles at junctions in the north of the West Bank. In other incidents, settlers were seen unleashing their dogs to attack homes of Palestinian civilians in the Hebron Governorate.

"In 2 weeks, Israelis kill a Palestinian, injure and detain dozens, demolish 21 structures, uproot hundreds of trees""",12/26/20 10:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122607,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, December 26, 2020 (WAFA) – In two weeks between the period of December 8 and 21, Israeli occupation forces and settlers killed one Palestinian, injured more than 80 others, detained 154 people, demolished or seized 21 Palestinian-owned structures, bulldozed dozens of dunums of agricultural land, and uprooted hundreds of trees and saplings in various parts of the occupied West Bank, according to the biweekly Protection of Civilians Report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs /OCHA/ in the occupied Palestinian territory.
It said that on 21 December, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy from Qabatiya in the north of the West Bank reportedly opened fire at a police post in the Old City of Jerusalem and was subsequently shot and killed by Israeli forces who chased him. A police officer reportedly fell while running and was lightly injured.
A total of 73 Palestinians, including 16 children, were injured in multiple clashes with Israeli occupation forces across the West Bank, said the report, the bulk of which /57/ were recorded in protests against settlement activities in Kafr Qaddum near Qalqilya, and al Mughayyir and Kafr Malik near Ramallah. Ten of the Palestinians injured during this period were hit by live ammunition, 17 by rubber bullets, and 40 were treated for inhaling tear gas.
Eight Palestinians, including three children, were also injured in attacks by Israeli settlers.
In three separate incidents, Israeli settlers physically assaulted and forced out of their land Palestinian farmers from the community of Susiya, injuring a boy and an elderly man; this is one of multiple communities in Area C at risk of forcible transfer.
After an Israeli settler was found dead on December 20 in a forest near the illegal Tal Menashe settlement in the Jenin area in the north of the West Bank, where she lived, a series of stone-throwing and physical assault incidents by Israeli settlers against Palestinians were reported in various parts of the West Bank injuring several Palestinians, including a boy and his father and a shepherd.
Israeli occupation forces carried out 183 search-and-arrest operations and detained 154 Palestinians across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, said OCHA.
A total of 21 Palestinian-owned structures were demolished or seized due to a lack of rarely-issued Israeli building permits, displacing 14 people and otherwise affecting over 100.
The year 2020 has recorded the second highest number of structures demolished /after 2016/ since OCHA began systematically documenting this practice in 2009.
Israeli forces bulldozed some 30 dunums of agricultural land near Suba village in the Hebron district on grounds that it had been declared ‘state land’. About 930 olive, grape, almond and cactus trees were uprooted or damaged during the incident, in addition to agricultural terraces, metal bars and fences and a gate. The livelihoods of eight families were affected.
In addition, Israeli settlers uprooted or damaged 740 Palestinian-owned trees and saplings in various parts of the West Bank.
Since the start of 2020, at least 8,550 trees have been damaged by Israeli settlers, said OCHA.

Morad Shtewi, an official in charge of the popular resistance file in the village, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring two of them, including a 10-year-old in his hand. Others also sustained suffocation from gas inhalation.
The injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
For many years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

Hundreds of protesters were taking part in a rally following the weekly Friday prayers in the area in protest of Israel's confiscation of large swathes of Palestinian land for the benefit of the colonial settlement construction. 
The protesters were met with brutal force, and Israeli soldiers fired teargas canisters and stun grenades to disperse the protest causing many cases of suffocation from teargas inhalation.
The area has witnessed weekly protests during the past few months against Israel's ongoing theft of Palestinian land for the benefit of the colonial Israeli settlement construction and expansion.
Villagers also recently set up a sit-in tent in the area in protest of the unjust Israeli policy of land grab.

NABLUS, Friday, December 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Israeli settlers protected by army last night attacked Palestinian vehicles driving at the main Nablus-Ramallah road, just near the village of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, according to local sources.
Rampaging settlers from the illegal settlements of Eli and Ma'ale Levona, built illegally near the village, gathered at the main street and pelted stones at Palestinian vehicles driving at the road. 
The settlers also attempted to raid homes of Palestinian citizens at the outskirts of the village. In response, Palestinian residents gathered at the entrance to the village and burned empty tires to fend off the attack and prevent the settlers from going deep into the village.
The attacks occurred in full sight of Israeli occupation soldiers who did nothing to stop the attack, according to witnesses.
There has been an increase in settler-related attacks against Palestinians and their properties during the last week.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.

"Settlers uproot olive trees near Hebron""",12/24/20 12:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122589,"
HEBRON, Thursday, December 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Thursday dozens of olive trees in the locality of At-Tuwani, south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to sources.
Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committees Rateb Jbour said that a group of settlers from the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Maon uprooted and stole some 35 olive trees belonging to the al-Arini family in the locality, east of Yatta town.
At-Tuwani 14 kilometers south of Hebron, At-Tuwani locality consists of two hamlets, and together with Masafer Yatta, a collection of almost 19 hamlets, cover 37,500 donums, and rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

"Settlers raze large tracts of Palestinian land south of Nablus""",12/23/20 15:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122581,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, December 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today razed large tracts of Palestinian land belonging to Awarta town, south of Nablus city, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said that settlers escorted several bulldozers to an area of the town’s land, known as al-Khirbeh, where the heavy machineries leveled the land to expand the nearby colonial settlement of Itamar.
Located some seven kilometers to the south of Nablus city, Awarta has a population of some 7,500 and occupies a total area of 13,450 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over 39 percent of the village’s land (some 5,300 dunams).  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Since the start of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, like so many other villages in Palestine, al-Khader has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Israel has seized an area of at least 2,450 dunums for the construction of Itamar colonial settlement, located to the northeast of the village. It has also seized more land to set up two military bases and five colonial outposts on the eastern hills of the settlement.
It has also isolated some 3,000 donums of land belonging to Awarta and other nearby Palestinian villages for the benefit of colonial settlement expansion, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

RAMALLAH, Wednesday, December 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today set up a tent on the land of Deir Jarir village, to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, local sources confirmed.
They said that the settlers, under military protection, set up a tent and a water tank on the plot of land and began digging work in the area. The villagers attempted to confront the settlers, but were pushed back by Israeli soldiers. 
They added that the area has been targeted for years by settlers, who let their animals graze on the villagers’ farms, causing great losses.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

"Israeli forces seal off archeological site near Nablus""",12/23/20 10:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122572,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, December 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning sealed off the archeological site of Sebastia, north of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, in preparation for a settler intrusion into the site, local sources said.
Mayor of Sebastia Mohammad Azem told WAFA that a large unit of Israeli soldiers raided the town and proceeded to close the site, preventing from Palestinians from accessing it in order to make room for settlers to storm it. 
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

They told WAFA that Israeli forces opened fire towards a Palestinian vehicle in al-Jalajel area, moderately injuring the driver before they detained him and seized his car.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

This step came after an Israeli settler was found dead in the village forests where she had gone for a run a day earlier.
Settlers exploit the alleged killing of any settler as a cover to set up new colonial settlement outposts.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, December 22, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a number of Palestinian structures in several areas to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Jerusalem, witnesses said.
They confirmed that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers stormed an area on Wadi al-Nar Road, close to al-Container checkpoint, where the heavy machineries a number of garages and commercial structures and the soldiers seized their content.
Meanwhile, Israeli police demolished the walls and foundations of a garage in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukabbir.
The garage owner, identified as Akram Shuqeirat, told WAFA that Israeli municipality of Jerusalem tore down his car repair shop, which was built using brick and tin sheet, causing destruction to his nearby plot of land. 
Israeli forces carried out another demolition, tearing down another Palestinian-owned garage in al-Eizariya town, east of Jerusalem. 
Owner of the demolished structure, located on the road connecting al-Eizariya to As-Sawahira and Abu Dis towns, was identified as as Mahmoud al-Basha. 
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Israeli forces order halt on construction of water well near Hebron""",12/22/20 12:18,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122556,"
HEBRON, Monday, December 21, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli forces today ordered a halt on the construction of a water well east of Ad-Dhahiriya town, southwest of Hebron city, according to sources.
Member of the Popular Committees in Southern Hebron, Rateb al-Jbour, told WAFA that Israeli forces stormed Khirbet Zanouta, east of the town, and close to the colonial settlement of Atniel, where they detained a Palestinian as he was constructing a well to collect rain water and seized the excavation machines, under the pretext that the area is classified Area C.
Khirbet Zanouta has become a frequent target for Israeli forces, who have tore down tents and livestock shacks as a means to displace the residents and make room for the expansion of colonial settlements.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers.

"Israel to punitively demolish house of alleged attacker south of Jenin""",12/22/20 11:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122555,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, December 22, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today threatened to demolish the family house of an alleged Palestinian attacker in Qabatiya town, south of Jenin.
Israeli forces summoned Omar Kmail, whose son, Mahmoud, was killed by Israeli police following an attempted attack in Jerusalem, to Salem detention and interrogation facility, where they threatened him to punitively demolish his house in the town.
Mahmoud, 17, was shot and killed last night by Israeli police near Bab Hutta, one of the gates to al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s old city, after he allegedly attempted to carry out a shooting attack.
This came as Palestinians declared a general strike to mourn the slain Palestinian youth.
Israel resorts to punitively demolish the family homes of Palestinians as a mean of deterrence- accused of being involved in attacks against Israelis, a policy that Israel does not apply to Israeli settlers who were involved in fatal attacks against Palestinians.
The policy was widely condemned by human rights groups as “a collective punishment” and “a war crime and crime against humanity”.

Coordinator of the Popular anti-wall and anti-settlements committees, Ratib al-Jabour, told WAFA that an Israeli military force stormed al-Simiya hamlet, northwest of al-Samou, where they tore down a 200-square-meter house and a 90-square-meter house displacing their families comprising of 20 members.
They also demolished a water well and a 500-square-meter livestock shed belonging to the same family.
Al-Jabour the demolitions intend to empty the area of its Palestinian residents in order to make room for the construction of illegal Israeli colonial settlements and bypass roads for the settlers.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel demolished over 7200 Palestinian-owned structures in the last 10 years, displacing over 10,000 people. Demolitions are typically carried out due to lack of Israeli-issued permits, which are nearly impossible to obtain, but in some cases the circumstances are different, including punitive demolitions and demolitions carried out as part of military activities.

The settlers also denied the farmers access and prevented them from plowing their own land.
The village is part of Masafer Yatta, a collection of about 19 hamlets that have been a frequent target of almost daily assaults by the Israeli military and settlers, who wish to empty the area of its indigenous Palestinian population for settlement expansion purposes.

SALFIT, Sunday, December 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Illegal Israeli settlers uprooted today a number of olive saplings belonging to Palestinian farmers in the village of Hares, near the town of Salfit in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
A group of settlers from the illegal Israeli settlement of Revava, nearby, raided a plot belonging to Amjad Sultan, a local Palestinian citizen and farmer, and uprooted olive saplings that he had recently planted in his own land.
This was the second attack of its kind by Israeli settlers in the same area in less than one month.

"Two Palestinian men injured in attacks by settlers in West Bank""",12/20/20 08:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122520,"
NABLUS, Sunday, December 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian men sustained injuries today and last night during two separate attacks by illegal Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
In the area of Ein El-Hilweh, in the northern Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank, settlers attacked herders with stones and injured one of them in the head.
Last night, a Palestinian man sustained bruises last night after he was assaulted by a group of rampaging Israeli settlers in the village of Huwara, to the south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli settlement activities in the area, told WAFA that settlers from the nearby illegal settlement of Yitzhar assaulted Nasser Mohammad Samara, causing him bruises across his body. He was moved to hospital for treatment.
The attack reportedly occurred in the presence of Israeli soldiers who provided the settlers with protection.
The settlement of Yitzhar is notorious for its hardcore Jewish settler community who in the past committed several attacks against Palestinians and their property, including arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Settler vandalism of Palestinian property in the occupied territories is almost a daily occurrence, and attacks by settlers are rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.

HEBRON, Saturday, December 19, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of hardcore, armed Israeli settlers accompanied by the occupation army attacked today homes of Palestinian citizens after raiding the neighborhood of Tel Rumeida in the city of Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, according to witnesses.
WAFA correspondent said the settlers pelted stones at the homes, shouted profanities and racist slogans at Palestinian citizens and threatened to evict them out of the neighborhood. 
Israeli soldiers who were accompanying the settlers in the attack reportedly did nothing to stop it, and rather provided the settlers with protection.
As a matter of fact, settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

NABLUS, Saturday, December 19, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli army today prevented Palestinians from planting olive trees in their lands in Jaloud village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, under the pretext it was ""state land,"" according to a Palestinian official.
Ghassan Daghlas, in charge of the settlements file in the Palestinian Authority, said the soldiers refused to allow the landowners to reach their lands located on the outskirts of the village and some 200 meters from Jaloud secondary school, claiming the land was state-owned.
However, the landowners refuted the army’s claim and said the land was privately-owned and that they have the documents to prove it.
The Israeli occupation authorities often use false pretexts to expropriate land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

The attack, he added, took place under the eyes and protection of Israeli soldiers who did not intervene to stop the settlers.
According to United Nations and human rights organization, Israeli settler attacks and violence against Palestinian civilians and their properties in the occupied West Bank have peaked in recent months and that most of the attacks were carried out in the presence and protection of Israeli soldiers.

QALQILIA, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) - Dozens of Palestinians suffocated today in the Israeli army crackdown on the weekly anti-settlements protest in the northern West Bank village of Kufr Qaddoum, according to local sources.

Sources said Israeli army soldiers suppressed the weekly peaceful protest, attacking demonstrators who also rallied to protest Israel’s closure of the main road that connects the village of Kufr Qaddoum with the city of Nablus since 2003.

Forces fired tear gas canisters and stun grenades toward protesters and homes, causing dozens to suffocate due to tear gas inhalation.

Protesters managed to shoot down an Israeli drone dropping tear gas canisters over Palestinian protesters.

“Before 2003, the residents of Kufr Qaddum would use a shorter road to the east in order to come and go to nearby cities and villages. However, as the settlements expanded so that they overwhelmed the road, it became closed for Palestinian use, said Addameer Human rights Association.

The only alternative road is roughly six times longer than the previous route, disrupting the villagers’ ability to attend university, their jobs, and other vital aspects of their economic and social well being, noted Addameer.

Although Kufr Qaddum’s Popular Resistance Committee took their case to the Israeli High Court in 2003, the legal status of the road remains unchanged, stressed Addameer.

After all legal appeals failed, villagers decided to organize weekly demonstrations in July 2011, a step that was met with violent suppression by Israeli forces.

JENIN, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian vehicles travelling along the Jenin-Nablus Road, close to Silat Ad-Dahr town, south of Jenin city, according to local sources.
They confirmed that a group of settlers hurled stones and empty bottles at Palestinian vehicles travelling along the Nablus-Jenin Road, also known as Road 60, smashing the windshields of four vehicles. 
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The number of settlers has almost tripled since the Oslo Accords of 1993, when settlers’ number estimated 252,000. Illegal colonial settlements have leapt from 144 to 515 in that time.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the colonial settlements is a “national interest.”

SALFIT, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today denied Palestinians access to their lands threatened with confiscation, west of Salfit city, according to local activists.
They said that Israeli troops set up checkpoints in the area of al-Ras, at the risk of expropriation to make room for the expansion of the Israeli colonial settlement of Ariel, as a means to prevent Palestinian villagers from rallying against the expropriation of this area. 
Soldiers also sealed off the entrances of Salfit city, denying all Palestinians who are non-residents of the city from taking part in the rally.
Secretary-General of Fatah branch in Salfit Abdul-Sattar Awwad pledged that the villagers would continue to organize such rallies to “foil all Israeli schemes aimed at liquidating the Palestinian question” and restore the confiscated lands.
The Israeli government is tacitly supporting settlers in their drive to fully take over al-Ras area for the construction of a new colonial outpost, which would form a part of the larger Ariel settlement. 
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The number of settlers has almost tripled since the Oslo Accords of 1993, when settlers’ number estimated 252,000. Illegal colonial settlements have leapt from 144 to 515 in that time.

NABLUS, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today destroyed water pipelines and trees in al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya village, south of Nablus city, according to a local source.
Khaled Daraghmeh, a local landowner, said that a group of settlers stormed his plot of land, known as Khan al-Laban area, famous for its water spring, in the village, destroying doors, water pipelines and his orange trees.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement of Ma'ale Levona, established in 1983 on the villagers’ lands. 
Daraghmeh pointed to the fact that Khan al-Laban, which dates back to the Ottoman era and covers an area of 300 donums, has been subject to frequent attack by settler, who enjoy the protection of the Israeli military, in order to seize as it is located in the area connecting the colonial settlements of Alie and Ma'ale Levona.

"Settlers break into Palestinian houses, assault owners south of Hebron""",12/18/20 10:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122493,"
HEBRON, Friday, December 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Friday morning broke into several Palestinian houses and assaulted their owners in Masafer Yatta village cluster, south of Hebron city, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees Fuad al-Amour said that a group of armed settlers, under the military protection, forced their way into several houses in al-Markez community, ransacking them.  
When the homeowners attempted to prevent the settlers from tampering with their houses, they were assaulted.
Another group of armed settlers sealed the entrances to Umm al-Kheir, At-Tuwani and Khirbet Shi‘b al-Butum hamlets, where they stopped and searched vehicles.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement outpost of Mitzpe Yair, located about a kilometer to the west of al-Markez community.
Umm al-Kheir and Shi‘b al-Butum are two of the Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta, a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.

"Israeli occupation forces fire teargas grenades inside West Bank school suffocating students, teachers""",12/17/20 13:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122485,"
JENIN, Thursday, December 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Palestinian students and teachers today suffocated from teargas fired by the Israeli military inside their school in Anin village, west of the northern West Bank city of Jenin, according to local sources.
They told WAFA that the Israeli army attack on the school caused injury and panic, and disrupted classes as teachers rushed to help the students chocked from the teargas.
The education directorate in Jenin condemned the attack on the school and called for holding Israel accountable for its crimes against Palestinian education, students and people.
Attacks on education by Israeli military forces and Israeli settlers in Palestine constitute grave violations of children’s rights to education and development. These attacks are particularly prevalent in the most vulnerable areas of the West Bank – Area C, H2 in Hebron, and East Jerusalem.

"The Israeli war continues against Palestinian trees: Settlers uproot hundreds of olive saplings in West Bank""",12/17/20 11:24,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122481,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, December 17, 2020 (WAFA) – In part of the Israeli war against Palestinian trees, settlers today uprooted hundreds of olive saplings in Kisan village, east of southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local official.
Head of Kisan village council, Ahmad Ghazzal, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal settlement of Ibei Hanahal uprooted and seized 250 olive saplings a local villager planted two weeks ago in his land west of Kisan.
The saplings’ vandalism came one day after Israeli settlers from the same illegal settlement attacked Palestinian shepherds while herding in the open pastures as their dogs attacked the sheep. The settlers then chased the shepherds into the village and pelted homes with stones before they were confronted by the residents and pushed out of the village.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and once occupied a total area of 133,330 dunums before the Israeli occupation authorities seized almost all of its land for its settlement activities, settlers’ bypass roads and its apartheid wall.

"Settlers storm archaeological site north of Nablus""",12/16/20 12:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122469,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, December 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Israeli settlers today stormed the archaeological site of Sebastia, north of Nablus city, according to a local source.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that scores of settlers forced their way into the archaeological site under the protection of the Israeli military, which declared the site temporarily off-limit for Palestinians.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli forces seize two tractors from Jericho-district village""",12/16/20 12:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122468,"
JERICHO, Wednesday, December 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today seized two tractors from the villagers of Az-Zubeidat, north of Jericho city, according to local sources.
They confirmed that Israeli soldiers seized the tractors at the entrance of the village.
Horizontally located some 35 kilometers to the north of Jercho, Az-Zubeidat has a population of some 1,800 and occupies a total area of some 4,123 donums. 
The villagers are originally Bedouin who were expelled from their lands during the Nakba in 1948. They depend on agriculture and livestock husbandry for their livelihood.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given control over a small pocket of land of 36 donums, which account for 1 percent of the village total area. In contrast, the Israeli occupation authorities maintain control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to underground water sources. The Israeli company of Mekorot has a monopoly over the excavation, restoration and distribution of water, while the villagers are forbidden from constructing new wells or restoring existing ones. The company extracts and diverts large quantities of groundwater for the benefit of the nearby colonial settlements.
Israel has seized thousands of donums of the village area for different purposes, including the construction of the nearby colonial settlement of Argaman and settler-only bypass road 90, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israeli settlers set up mobile home east of Hebron""",12/16/20 11:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122467,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, December 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Wednesday morning set up once again a mobile home on the lands of al-Baq‘a village, east of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to local sources.
The landowner, ‘Aref Jaber, told WAFA that the settlers, under heavy military protection, proceeded to rebuild the structure, torn down by the villagers few days ago, on his plot of land in the village, located adjacent to the Israeli colonial settlement of Qiryat Arba‘.
Jaber added that his land covers a complete hill, which overlooks large parts of the 50-donum area, which the settlers are striving to take over for the expansion of nearby colonial settlements.
He confirmed that he has title deeds proving that the hill is his private property, as he called upon human rights commissions to help him protect his land from confiscation.
Horizontally located some four kilometers to the east of Hebron at an altitude of 915 meters above sea level, al-Baq‘a village has a population of some 1,500, whose majority depends on agriculture and livestock rearing for livelihood.
The village occupies a total area of 1,500 donums, 150 donums of which are classified as built-up area, 600 dunams are classified as arable land, including 100 dunams cultivated with grape trees and vegetables, and 450 others classified as forests and open spaces.
The Israeli occupation authorities have seized at least 1,000 dunams during the second Intifada, including 600 donums for the construction of the section of Israel’s apartheid wall, which isolates the villages from the east and north and pushes the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
The construction of the wall resulted in the confiscation of an additional 100 donums and the destruction of some 2,000 trees.

"Palestinians fend off settler attack in Bethlehem-district village""",12/16/20 11:34,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122466,"
BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, December 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Palestinian villagers Tuesday night fended off an Israeli settler attack against Kisan village, located to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to sources.
Mayor of Kisan, Ahmad Ghazal, told WAFA that 20 Israeli settlers in three vehicles sneaked their way into the village, and pelted some of the villagers’ houses with stones before they were confronted by the villagers and forced to retreat. 
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement of Eibi Hanhel, also written as Eibi Hankhal, established on lands seized from the village.
Ghazal added that this was not the first settler attack against the village as settlers and Israeli forces have frequently targeted the villagers and their properties. Such attacks included home and shack demolitions and land confiscation for the benefit of colonial settlement expansion.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides to the settlement outpost ofIbei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land. 
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

HEBRON, Tuesday, December 15, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today razed a large tract of Palestinian land and uprooted trees to the west of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, security and local sources said.
The sources told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers into Souba area, located between Dura and Idhna towns and adjacent to the section of Israel’s apartheid wall, where the heavy machineries leveled 50 donums of farmland, demolished a well used to collect rain water and uprooted dozens of olive trees .
The property owner was identified as Ali Baryoush.
While Israel demolishes Palestinian structures across the West Bank, particularly in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

"Israel approves building thousands of colonial settler units south of Jerusalem""",12/15/20 12:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122450,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, December 15, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities have approved the building of thousands of new colonial settler units at the expense of seized Palestinian land extending from Beit Safafa neighborhood to al-Walaja village, south of Jerusalem.
The 48 Arabs website said that that Israel has approved the construction of 8,300 new colonial settler units for residential, industrial and commercial purposes on Palestinian land belonging to several villages and neighborhoods in Jerusalem and Bethlehem districts, including Beit Safafa, Malha, al-Baqa'a and all the way to al-Walaja.
This step, the website added, would effectively expand the borders of the new settlement industrial zone of Talpiot.
The implementation of the construction scheme, which involves building towers up to 30 floors high, is scheduled to begin by 2021, and work will continue until 2040.
Meanwhile, the National Bureau for Defending Land and Resisting Settlements (NBPRS) stated in its latest weekly report, that several indicators on the ground show that Israel has lifted the annexation plan from the table only to deceive the public opinion and the international community, at a time when the infrastructure for the annexation project is implemented through “bypassing annexation” settlement units, and streets among the colonial settlements aiming to turn the West Bank by 2045 into a new Galilee.
“In Jerusalem and its environs, the occupation government does not stop its settlement projects, as it aims to create a large settlement belt around Jerusalem by constructing new settlement roads and streets aimed at preventing any expansion or geographical contact of the people of Jerusalem from the south as part of the so-called ‘Jerusalem Envelope Belt’,” NBPRS said. 
“The occupation municipality in Jerusalem began its actual steps aimed at paving a new road at the beginning of next year, linking the new settlement outpost, Mordot, with the settlement of Gilo, south of occupied Jerusalem, at the expense of the confiscated Palestinian lands belonging to the residents of Walaja, Beit Safafa and the area south of Jerusalem,” it added.

Human rights activist Aref Daraghme said Israeli soldiers seized a tractor owned by al-Maleh village council in the northern Jordan Valley while helping Palestinian farmers in reclaiming and plowing their lands in order to plant them.
He said the soldiers also impounded a car owned by the head of al-Maleh village council Mahdi Daraghme.
Israel attempts to reduce Palestinian activity and presence in the Jordan Valley, which makes almost a third of the area of the occupied West Bank and considered the breadbasket of Palestine, after it decided to annex it, a step that has provoked worldwide condemnation.

Ghassan Daghlas, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli violations in the area, told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces handed local residents a notice ordering them to stop the construction of the three homes and the two barns, under the pretext of lacking an Israeli construction permit.
The homes and barns belong to five Palestinian citizens from Qaryout.
The area where the construction is ordered to stop is classified as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli administrative and military control, where Israel rarely issues construction permits to Palestinians, forcing many people to build without permits.
Israel refuses to allow Palestinian development of any kind in Area C and often demolishes what Palestinians build despite the Israeli ban.

HEBRON, Sunday, December 13, 2020 (WAFA) – A group of rampaging Israeli settlers last night attacked homes of Palestinian citizens near the town of Sa'ir, to the northeast of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian security sources.
Settlers attacked homes in the outskirts of the town, shouted profanities at their residents and threatened to murder them and burn their homes.
In the meantime, Israeli occupation forces raided the city of Bethlehem, south of the occupied West Bank, and detained five Palestinians after raiding and searching their homes.
Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities. It includes arsons of property and mosques, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

"Thousands of Israelis protest against Netanyahu for 25th week """,12/13/20 08:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122421,"
TEL AVIV, Sunday, December 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israeli protesters demonstrated last night for the 25th week across the country demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down over long-running corruption charges.
Israeli media outlets said the main rallies were held outside the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem and outside his private home in the coastal city of Caesarea. Around two thousand people attended the protest in Jerusalem and several hundred attended the one in Caesarea.
Smaller demonstrations also took place at highway overpasses and junctions around the country on Saturday night. Some demonstrators at the Prime Minister’s Residence marched with torches.
One of the protest groups promised to hold a “siege” at the Prime Minister’s Residence, after 27 demonstrators were arrested at last week’s demonstration for attempting to block the entrances and exits to the home on Balfour Street, according to Israeli media. 
The months-long protests began last spring when Netanyahu and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to form what they called an emergency government focused on managing the health and economic challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Their partnership has been paralyzed by infighting, and a pair of lockdowns hit the economy hard, sending unemployment skyrocketing to double-digit figures.
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial is scheduled to enter its evidentiary phase in January.

"Israeli settlers backed by army forces attack Palestinian journalist in Hebron""",12/12/20 18:34,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122418,"
HEBRON, Saturday, December 12, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers living in occupied West Bank settlements attacked today evening a Palestinian journalist in Tel al-Rumeida neighborhood in Hebron's city, in the southern occupied West Bank, according to WAFA correspondent.

WAFA correspondent said several settlers from the nearby illegal Israeli settlements of Ramat Yishai and Beit Hadassah beat up Palestinian journalist Mohanned Qafesheh in his home city in Hebron, causing him injuries to the head.

The journalist, Qafesheh, who works for Palestine Sports Channel, said he attempted to defend himself against the settlers' attack while Israeli forces stood idly by and provided the settlers with protection while they beat him up.

B'Tselem, the Israeli information center for human rights in occupied territories, said: ""Settler violence has long since become part of Palestinians’ daily life under occupation. Israeli security forces enable these actions, which result in Palestinian casualties – injuries and fatalities – as well as damage to land and property. In some cases, they even serve as an armed escort, or even join in the attacks.""

""Investigations, if even opened, are usually closed with no action taken against perpetrators as part of an undeclared policy of leniency. The long-term effect of this violence is the dispossession of Palestinians from increasing parts of the West Bank, making it easier for Israel to take over land and resources,"" stated the center.

Under international law, Israel has a duty to protect Palestinians in the West Bank from this conduct. However, Israeli authorities routinely shirk this responsibility, even when violent actions can be anticipated. Thousands of testimonies, videos, and reports, as well as many years of close monitoring by B’Tselem and other organizations, reveal that Israeli security forces not only allow settlers to harm Palestinians and their property as a matter of course – they often provide the perpetrators escort and back-up.

QALQILIA, Saturday, December 12, 2020 (WAFA) – At least one Palestinian protester was injured and many others suffocated from teargas today, as Israeli occupation forces attacked a protest against Israeli settlements in the village of Kafr Qaddum in the north of the occupied West Bank, local sources said.
Morad Shtewi, an official in charge of the popular resistance file in the village, told WAFA that Israeli occupation soldiers raided the village, clashed with the protesters, and attacked them with rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring one of them and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
The injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
During the raid, the occupation soldiers stormed a house in the village, forced their residents into one room for four hours and demolished some of its internal walls.
For many years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every week against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

Abdul-Nasser Walid Halaweh, 56 years old from the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, was shot and injured by Israeli troops on August 16 while attempting to cross the said checkpoint. 
His sister told WAFA that on that day, Israeli occupation soldiers manning the checkpoint shouted at him to stop while trying to cross the checkpoint, but due to his hearing disability he did not hear the soldiers, who were quick to open gunfire at him in the feet causing him serious fragmentations in the bones.
He was announced dead today due to complications resulting from his wounds.

"Israeli forces crackdown on sapling-planting protest east of Nablus, injuries confirmed """,12/11/20 14:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122405,"
NABLUS, December 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday afternoon cracked down on an olive-sapling-planting event in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, causing a number of injuries, according to a local official.
The village mayor Nasser Abu Jaish said that a large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the event called for to plant olive saplings in the villagers’ lands threatened with confiscation, northeast of the village. 
Soldiers opened fire towards the participants, hitting two with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing 15 others to suffocate from tear gas.
The village has become the scene of weekly protests against the Israeli occupation authorities’ move to construct and expand colonial settlements at the expense of 300 donums of the villagers’ land.
Such events came in the wake of the construction of a new settlement outpost on the territories of the village. Settlers installed an animal barn, extended water pipelines to supply the new outpost with water, and built a several-kilometers road, causing damage and seizing hundreds of donums of the villagers’ land. 
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

SALFIT, Friday, December 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today denied Palestinians access to their lands threatened with confiscation, west of Salfit city, according to WAFA correspondent.
She said that Israeli troops tightened restrictions on the access of Palestinians to their lands in the area of al-Ras, at the risk of expropriation to make room for the expansion of the Israeli colonial settlement of Ariel.
Secretary-General of Fatah branch in Salfit Abdul-Sattar Awwad said that the Israeli government is tacitly supporting settlers in their drive to fully take over al-Ras area for the construction of a new colonial outpost, which would form a part of the larger Ariel settlement. 
There are over 500,000 Israeli Jewish settlers living in settlements across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which comes in violation of international law.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The number of settlers has almost tripled since the Oslo Accords of 1993, when settlers’ number estimated 252,000. Illegal colonial settlements have leapt from 144 to 515 in that time.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the colonial settlements is a “national interest.”

RAMALLAH, Friday, December 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-settlement protest in al-Mughayyir village, northeast of Ramallah, causing a number of protestors to suffocate, according to local source.
Head of the Committee against Settlement and the Apartheid Wall Walid Assaf said that Israeli soldiers violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend Ras al-Tin area against being seized to make room for the construction of a new Israeli colonial settlement outpost.
Soldiers opened fire towards the participants as the latter were reached the village entrance on their way to Ras al-Tin area, which is part of the nearby village of Kafr Malik, causing a number of participants to suffocate from tear gas inhalation.
Assaf pointed that the rally was also held to commemorate 15-year-old Ali Abu Alia, who was shot and killed by Israeli forces after receiving a live bullet in the abdomen as he participated in the weekly demonstration in al-Mughayyer village last Friday.
He was standing among the crowds when an Israeli soldier shot him in the abdomen, killing him on his 15th birthday.
Israeli settlers have recently commenced the construction of the new colonial settlement outpost in Ras al-Tin area, and prevented the villagers and shepherds from reaching the area.
Settlers are also attempting to demolish the school in the area, constructed with funding from the European Union, in preparation to force the Palestinian Bedouin community from this area.

"Settlers set up mobile home as means to seize Palestinian land east of Hebron""",12/11/20 11:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122400,"
HEBRON, Friday, December 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Friday morning set up a mobile home on Palestinian land in al-Baq‘a village, east of Hebron city, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that a group of settlers set up a mobile home atop a hill in the village, located adjacent to the Israeli colonial settlement of Qiryat Arba‘.
The hill, whose owner was identified as ‘Aref Jaber, overlooks large parts of the 50-donum area, which the settlers are striving to take over for the expansion of nearby colonial settlements.
The landowner, Jaber, confirmed that the hill is his private property, and he possesses the title deeds to it.
Horizontally located some four kilometers to the east of Hebron at an altitude of 915 meters above sea level, al-Baq‘a village has a population of some 1,500, whose majority depends on agriculture and livestock rearing for livelihood.
The village occupies a total area of 1,500 donums, 150 donums of which are classified as built-up area, 600 dunams are classified as arable land, including 100 dunams cultivated with grape trees and vegetables, and 450 others classified as forests and open spaces. 
The Israeli occupation authorities have seized at least 1,000 dunams during the second Intifada, including 600 donums for the construction of the section of Israel’s apartheid wall, which isolates the villages from the east and north and pushes the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
The construction of the wall resulted in the confiscation of an additional 100 donums and the destruction of some 2,000 trees.
The village is flanked by three Israeli colonial settlements, Qiryat Arba‘ to the south, Ramat Mamre (Kharsine) to the west and Qiryat Five to northwest.

JENIN, Thursday, December 10, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Israeli settlers escorted by army today broke into the site of an abandoned Israeli settlement south of the city of Jenin, north of the occupied West Bank, provoking clashes with local Palestinian protesters from neighboring villages, local sources said.
The settlers performed rituals at the site and chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during their provocative tour to Sa-Nur, an Israeli settlement which was abandoned by the Israeli occupation authorities as part of a partial disengagement plan in 2005.
Palestinian protesters from neighboring villages were quick to protest against the settlers' provocative tour, and clashes erupted with the occupation forces shortly afterwards.

"Palestinian activist receives Israeli demolition order against his home in Silwan in East Jerusalem""",12/10/20 11:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122386,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, December 10, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian activist from occupied East Jerusalem today received an Israeli demolition order against his home in Silwan neighborhood.
Fakhri Abu Diab, member of the Defense of Silwan Land Committee, told WAFA that Israeli police accompanied members of the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem raided his home in al-Bustan area of Silwan, and handed him the demolition order under the pretext it was built without a permit.
Abu Diab said he paid over $30,000 in fines to prepare the papers needed to get the building license but that the Israeli municipality insists on the demolition as part of its policy of preventing Palestinian construction and development in Jerusalem while building for Israelis thousands of housing units in dozens of illegal settlements in occupied East Jerusalem.
Abu Diab is active in defending Silwan land from being taken over by Israel for settlement purposes.

THE GOLAN, Wednesday, December 09, 2020 (WAFA) – Syrian residents of the occupied Golan Heights observed today a general strike in protest against Israel’s installation of wind turbines on agricultural lands owned by the local residents.
Reports said Israeli occupation forces fired teargas and rubber-coated metal bullets at residents who gathered in the fields earlier in the morning in an effort to prevent the installation of the turbines. Two were injured, said the reports.
The strike was called for by Golani organizations, which urged the public to foil the attempt to install the huge wind turbines in their lands.
Over the past two days, the Israeli forces closed a number of main roads in Golan Heights and prevented people from accessing their agricultural lands in the area where the turbines will be installed.
Nevertheless, a number of local residents gathered on the roads leading to their agricultural lands to prevent the Israeli forces from reaching the targeted sites.

The demolition orders were issued against six residential structures, two water wells, and four agricultural rooms built from metal panels located near the illegal colonial outpost of Maon under the pretext that they were built without a permit and close to a bypass road, according to Fouad al-Amour, the coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committee in Masafer Yatta.
The structures slated for demolition are owned by two local Palestinian families.
He added that the Israeli authorities issued several demolition orders and demolished a number of structures in Masafer Yatta in an attempt to empty that area of its Palestinian residents for the benefit of settlement expansion.

"Israeli forces infiltrate Gaza’s border, raze farmlands """,12/9/20 12:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122322,"
GAZA, Wednesday, December 09, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today infiltrated Gaza’s border, southeast of Gaza city, and razed farmlands, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli military tanks and bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters of to the east of Juhor Ad-Dik area, southeast of Gaza city, and proceeded to raze borderline farmlands and set up earth mounds as they intermittently opened fire.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Suffocation cases confirmed as Israeli forces storm Nablus-district town""",12/9/20 10:57,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122321,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, December 09, 2020 (WAFA) – A number of Palestinians Wednesday morning suffered from suffocation during an Israeli raid to Sebastia town, north of the West Bank city of Nablus, according to a local official.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that Israeli soldiers forced their way into the town, backed by a military bulldozer, while opening intense fire to secure the site for settlers, who are expected to storm the archaeological site of the town.
As a result, a number of the town residents suffocated from tear gas inhalation.
The archaeological site has become a scene for daily settler targeting and encroachments, particularly following the opening of a Palestinian tourist project, known as Bydar Project, and hoisting a large Palestinian flag. 
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

JENIN, Wednesday, December 09, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Palestinians Wednesday early morning were injured from Israeli military gunfire as Israeli forces raided Jaba‘ town, to the south of Jenin city, according to a local activist.
Razi Ghannam, a Fatah official, told WAFA that Israeli forces barged their way into the town in the early morning hours, ransacking several houses and interrogating their residents.
In the ensuing confrontations, Israeli forces opened fire towards local youngsters, injuring six with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing dozens other to suffocate from tear gas canisters.
He added that the Red Crescent crews provided treatment to a number of casualties at the scene, and rushed some others to a hospital in Jenin.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given control over a small pocket of land classified as Area A, which occupies 16,519 dunums and accounts for 15.5 percent of the village’s total area. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to water in the area, particularly its water springs, including Ein al-Auja (al-Auja spring), which are located within Area C.
Israel has seized at least 2,257dunums of land belonging to the village for the construction of four nearby colonial settlements, 2,152 dunums for the construction of a military base, and more land for opening settler bypass roads, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

"Palestinian minor says he was severely beaten by Israeli soldiers during detention; suffered broken jaw, teeth""",12/8/20 11:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122308,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, December 08, 2020 (WAFA) – A 16-year-old Palestinian minor told his lawyer that he was severely beaten when detained by Israeli occupation soldiers last week and that he suffered a broken jaw and teeth, as well as bruises and cuts all over his body.
Mamoun al-Hashem, an attorney with the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, said that Mohammad Moqbel, from Arroub refugee camp, north of the occupied southern West Bank city of Hebron, told him when he visited him yesterday at Hadassa Hospital in West Jerusalem, where he is getting treatment while in detention, that he was severely beaten by the Israeli soldiers when he was detained last Tuesday at the refugee camp.
He said Moqbel was in stable condition at the hospital and that he underwent surgery on his jaw two days ago that lasted for more than three hours.
Moqbel told his lawyer that he was in the camp when clashes broke out between youths and Israeli soldiers, who fired tear gas and stun grenades at the youths forcing him to run away with other kids. Three soldiers followed them and he took refuge in a home before one of the soldiers followed him into the house where he caught him and hit him powerfully with his rifle butt on his left jaw.
The soldier then pulled Moqbel out of the house and threw him on the ground. Other soldiers joined in beating him and kicking him while he was on the ground. As a result, he was left with several injuries and bruises while bleeding from the mouth for 10 minutes before he was thrown into an Israeli military vehicle. Three other minors were in the jeep, he said, and the soldiers kept putting their feet on them while cursing them.
The kids were then handcuffed and taken to Etzion detention facility in the south of the occupied West Bank where Moqbel was brought before interrogators who assaulted him verbally and accused him of throwing stones at the soldiers. After the interrogation, he was left in an open area in very cold weather conditions for six hours. At midnight he was put in a cell but due to the severe pain he was suffering and the screaming, he was taken to Hadassa Hospital the next morning where an x-ray showed that he had a broken jaw and teeth caused by the hard beating he received from the soldiers.

NABLUS, Tuesday, December 08, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities notified Palestinian landowners of a plan to seize large tracts of their land, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said Israeli forces handed notices to seize hundreds of dunums of land belonging to the villagers of Burin, Madama, and Asira al-Qibliya, south of Nablus, in order to expand the colonial settlement of Yitzhar and construct a new bypass road.
He added that the Israeli occupation authorities are dealing with Yitzhar, notorious for its hardcore religious community, as a town, and, as such, are reclassifying land surrounding it from agricultural to built-up area in order to expand the settlement.

"Israeli settlers infringe on private Palestinian land in Jerusalem, collide with landowners""",12/7/20 17:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122300,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, December 07, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today infringed on private Palestinian land in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan and when the landowners attempted to stop them, a quarrel broke out and one of the settlers pulled his private gun in the face of the Palestinian landowners, according to a local source. (Watch video here)
Khaled Abu Tayeh, member of the Committee for the Defense of Silwan Land, told WAFA that the settlers broke into Wadi al-Rababa land, which is under threat of takeover by the Israeli occupation authorities, and when the landowners confronted them, a brawl broke out.
He said one of the settlers pulled a gun to threaten the landowners with it.
Abu Tayeh said the Israeli so-called Nature Preservation Authority has been infringing on Wadi al-Rababa land, the latest of which was today, in an attempt to take it over, but that the landowners have regularly confronted them.
Israel, particularly, and the West Jerusalem Israeli municipality have been targeting Silwan since its occupation in June 1967, banning Palestinian construction and development while encouraging settlers to take over Palestinian land and homes in an effort to turn it into a Jewish neighborhood. Part of it has even been called City of David where an illegal settlement was built.

JORDAN VALLEY, Sunday, December 06, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli army forces set up today several caravans in al-Farsiya area in the northern Jordan Valley, according to local activist Aref Daraghmeh.

Israeli forces often use the al-Fariya area as a military training zone.

Palestinian residents of the Jordan Valley regularly face evictions due to Israeli military exercises on or near their land. 

According to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, Israeli military training in the Jordan Valley “causes unreasonable disruption to the lives of the communities in the area.”

"Two Palestinian detainees released after 3-year imprisonment in Israeli jails""",12/6/20 16:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122281,"
JENIN, Sunday, December 06, 2020 (WAFA) - Two Palestinian minor detainees, aged 17, was released today after spending a three-year sentence in Israeli jails, according to the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS).

Director of PPS Office Muntaser Mansour told WAFA Israeli forces detained Ahmad Zaqzooq and Mohammed Abu Maryam, from Jenin's village of al-Jadida, after shooting and injuring them near Zaatara military checkpoint to the south of Nablus three years ago.

Israeli forces opened fire at Zaqzooq and Abu Maryam at Zaatara checkpoint before detaining them. Zaqzooq was struck in the knee with a live bullet, whereas Abu Maryam had a gunshot to the thigh.
They spent two months at Ramala prison hospital before being transferred to Ofer jail and then to Megiddo prison, where they spent the rest of their imprisonment sentence.

At the end of September 2020, 157 Palestinian minors were held in Israeli prisons as security detainees and prisoners, at least two of whom were held in administrative detention, said B'Tselem, the Israeli information center for human rights in the occupied territories.

Each year approximately 500-700 Palestinian children from the occupied West Bank are prosecuted in Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated, and detained by the Israeli army, police, and security agents.

JORDAN VALLEY, Sunday, December 06, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today prevented Palestinian farmers from working in their own lands in the village of Atouf, in the northern Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank, local source said.
Muataz Bsharat, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli colonial activities in the Jordan Valley, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers prevented the farmers from accessing their lands and seized two bulldozers belonging by two local residents.
Around 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 nomadic communities in the Jordan Valley in places earmarked for military use and have to obtain permission from the Israeli occupation authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.

"Thousands of Israelis take part in anti-Netanyahu protests""",12/6/20 09:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122272,"
TEL AVIV, Sunday, December 6, 2020 (WAFA) – Several thousand Israeli protesters gathered last night outside the official residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in occupied Jerusalem, demanding his resignation over long-running corruption charges.
The protesters have been gathering there weekly for the past six months, saying Netanyahu should step down because of his corruption trial and mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.  
Other smaller protesters were also held in many locations across Israel, and at least 25 protesters were rounded up by the police. In Tel Aviv, an 82-year-old protester died after being hit by a car during a rally. The victim, Dror Soffer, was the father of Facebook Israel CEO Adi Soffer-Teeni, Israeli media outlets said.
The protests began last spring when Netanyahu and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to form what they called an emergency government focused on managing the health and economic challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Their partnership has been paralyzed by infighting, and a pair of lockdowns hit the economy hard, sending unemployment skyrocketing to double-digit figures.
With wintry weather settling in, the crowds have begun to shrink. But participants remained vocal and animated yesterday. 
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial is scheduled to enter its evidentiary phase in January.

SALFIT, Friday, December 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Palestinian nonviolent protesters were injured today when Israeli occupation forces attacked two nonviolent protests against the colonial Israeli settlements, which took place in the town of Salfit and the village of Kafr Qaddum in the occupied West Bank, said WAFA correspondent.
Soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and stun grenades at Palestinians who were demonstrating in the area of Al-Ras, near Salfit town, in protest of Israel’s plan to confiscate large tracts of Palestinian land in the area for the benefit of the Israeli colonial settlement enterprise. At least one protester was hit and injured in the foot, while many others sustained suffocation from gas inhalation. 
Another protester was also run over and moderately injured by an Israeli military vehicle which was laying an ambush for the protesters. All of the wounded were treated at the scene by local medics.
In the meantime, Israeli occupation soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters who were demonstrating in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near Qalqilia city, against Israeli settlements, causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
For several weeks now, Palestinians have held protests in the said two areas along with many other points of friction across the occupied West Bank to voice concern over the growing Israeli colonial settlement activities. Almost every day, clashes erupt between Palestinian protesters and Israeli occupation forces there.

RAMALLAH, Friday, December 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday afternoon cracked down on an anti-settlement protest in al-Mughayyir village, northeast of Ramallah, according to local source.
Mayor of al-Mughayyir Amin Abu-Alya said that an Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend Ras al-Tin area against being seized to make room for the construction of a new Israeli colonial settlement outpost, triggering confrontations.
Soldiers opened fire towards the participants as the latter reached the eastern entrance of al-Mughayyir on their way to Ras al-Tin area, which is part of the nearby village of Kafr Malik, hitting a 14-year-old teen with a live round in his abdomen and four other participants with rubber-coated steel bullets.  
The teen was rushed to a Ramallah hospital, where medics described his condition as critical, while the other casualties were treated at the scene of confrontations.
Israeli settlers have recently commenced the construction of the new colonial settlement outpost in Ras al-Tin area, and prevented the villagers and shepherds from reaching the area.
Settlers are also attempting to demolish the school in the area, constructed with funding from the European Union, in preparation to force the Palestinian Bedouin community from this area.

"Settler tries to burn Gethsemane Church in Jerusalem""",12/4/20 15:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122245,"
JERUSALEM, Friday, December 4, 2020 (WAFA) – An Israeli settler attempted today on burning down the Gethsemane Church in the Mount of Olives area in occupied East Jerusalem, according to local sources.
Witnesses reported that the settler, pretending to be a visitor, sneaked into the premises of the church before he was seen pouring some flammable liquid there. The settler then tried to set some of the wooden pews on fire, but was thwarted by local Palestinian citizens who handed him over to a police force which had just arrived at the scene.
The Israeli occupation police provided no details about the attack, but past attacks on churches across historical Palestine have been blamed on hardcore Jewish extremists. 
In 2015, Jewish extremists were blamed for an arson attack that caused extensive damage to the Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fish, a popular pilgrimage site on the Sea of Galilee in the north of Israeli-occupied historical Palestine.
The Gethsemane Church, sometimes referred to as the Church of All Nations, is a Catholic church built on the traditional site of the Garden of Gethsemane, where Christians believe Jesus was betrayed by Judas, one of his followers, and arrested by the Romans before being crucified.

"HRW: Israeli restrictions harm people with disabilities in Gaza """,12/3/20 15:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122237,"
GAZA, Thursday, December 3, 2020 (WAFA) - Israel’s 13-year closure of the Gaza Strip along with neglect by the Hamas authorities significantly encumber the day-to-day life of tens of thousands of Palestinians with disabilities, Human Rights Watch said today on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  
“More than a decade of Israeli restrictions have robbed people with disabilities in Gaza of their freedom of movement, and often access to the devices, electricity, and technology they need to communicate or leave their homes,” said Emina Cerimovic, senior researcher in the disability rights division at Human Rights Watch. “These policies, alongside the failure of Hamas authorities to address the lack of accessibility across Gaza and widespread stigma, contribute to making life in Gaza extraordinarily difficult for many people with disabilities.”
Since 2007, Israeli occupation authorities have imposed a generalized travel ban that deprives the two million Palestinians in Gaza of their freedom to leave the 365-square-kilometer strip, outside of narrow exceptions. Israeli authorities have also sharply restricted the entry and exit of goods from Gaza. Israel’s closure of Gaza, exacerbated by Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, limits access to health care, clean water, and electricity, as well as educational, economic, and other opportunities.
According to official statistics from the Palestinian Census Bureau, about 48,000 people in Gaza, or about 2.4 percent of the population, have a disability, more than one-fifth of whom are children. A United Nations Children’s’ Fund (UNICEF) official estimates that the actual figure is much higher. 
The World Health Organization estimates that about 15 percent of the world’s population has a disability. Some people acquired a disability following injuries stemming from the Israeli authorities’ use of force.
A December 2019 report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) notes that 498,776 Gaza residents, or nearly 25 percent of Gaza’s population, experience psychosocial distress and have a mental health condition.
“Both Israeli and Palestinian authorities have systematically overlooked people with disabilities in Gaza,” Cerimovic said. “The Israeli-imposed electricity crisis, shortages of assistive devices, and an inaccessible physical environment, block people with disabilities from living independently and fully participating in their communities.”

SALFIT, Thursday, December 3, 2020 (WAFA) - Dozens of Palestinian nonviolent protesters were injured by rubber-coated rounds while others suffocated from teargas today, after Israeli occupation forces attacked them while demonstrating against the colonial Israeli settlements near the town of Salfit, in the center of the occupied West Bank.
Israeli occupation soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and stun grenades at the protesters to disperse them, injuring over 30 protesters and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation. 
Mahmoud al-Aloul, Deputy Chairman of ruling Fatah Movement, and Walid Assaf, the Head of the Palestinian Government's Committee Against Settlements and the Apartheid Wall, were among the protesters who suffocated after being attacked with teargas by the occupation forces. 
The protesters were holding a nonviolent demonstration against Israel's plan to confiscate more Palestinian land in the area for the benefit of the Israeli colonial settlement enterprise. In recent weeks, illegal Israeli settlers placed caravans in the same area in a prelude to establish a new settlement.

"Several protestors injured as Israeli settlers storm Joseph’s Tomb near Nablus""",12/3/20 10:53,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122230,"
NABLUS, Thursday, December 03, 2020 (WAFA) – Several Palestinian protestors were injured from Israeli military gunfire as Israeli settlers stormed Joseph’s Tomb in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, according to security sources.
Israeli forces escorted a convoy of buses packed with hundreds of fanatic Jewish settlers into the site, located in the Palestinian-controlled area, sparking confrontations with Palestinian residents.
Soldiers opened fire on Palestinians protesting the raid and attempting to block settlers’ access to the site, injuring several protestors with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing dozens others to suffocate from tear gas.
Settlers repeatedly break into Joseph’s Tomb, located in a densely Palestinian populated area in Nablus, provoking chaos and confrontation with local residents.
The site of Joseph’s Tomb is contentious. Palestinians believe the site to be the funerary monument to Sheikh Yousef Dweikat, a local religious figure, while Israeli settlers believe it to belong to the Biblical Patriarch Joseph. 
Israel  uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, December 2, 2020 (WAF) - The Higher Islamic Council in Jerusalem today called on the Israeli occupation authorities to immediately stop their malicious intrusions against Muslim cemeteries in the occupied holy city.
It said in a statement that the changes Israeli intends to institute in East Jerusalem, which would change the features of the city in general and its two cemeteries located on the outer bounds of Jerusalem’s old city wall, the Yusufiya and Bab al-Rahma cemeteries, in addition to the Umayyad palaces in particular, “are measures intended to change the facade of the city of civilizations and obliterate its Arab and Islamic landmarks while according it Jewish characters.”
The Council stressed, in particular, the Israeli attacks against the Yusufiya cemetery that extends along the eastern wall of Jerusalem’s old city and adjacent to Bab al-Rahma cemetery that extends along the eastern wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque and said the Israeli occupation authorities have rummaged its graves and demolished the stairs leading to the cemetery while denying Muslims the right to bury their dead at the historic Bab al-Rahma cemetery.
The Higher Islamic Council considered the Israeli measures in these cemeteries, as well as at Mammilla Islamic cemetery in West Jerusalem, as ""illegitimate and unacceptable assaults, rejected by all religious, humanitarian and international standards.""
It called on Arab and Islamic governments to shoulder their responsibilities towards Jerusalem and its holy places, primarily Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is facing serious dangers from all sides.

"Palestinians voice concern over new colonial settlement in Hebron’s Old City""",12/1/20 16:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122204,"
HEBRON, Tuesday, December 01, 2020 (WAFA) – Palestinians today voiced concerns over the establishment of a new Israeli colonial settlements at the site of a newly-dismantled military camp in Hebron’s Old City, according to a local activist.
Imad Abu Shamsiyya, an activist working with the Youths against Settlements (YAS), an organization that documents human rights abuses carried out by the Israeli military in Hebron, said that the Israeli occupation authorities started the dismantling of a military camp at Ash-Shuhada Street, which has been closed since the 1994 massacre.
He voiced his concerns that this could serve as a prelude to the creation of a new colonial settlement at the site of the camp, given the recent successive visits of settler leaders and members of Knesset to the site.  
Twenty two years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

They confirmed that the staff of the Israeli municipality and forces escorted a bulldozer into the town, where the heavy machinery demolished a house purportedly for being built without a license.
Also today, a Palestinian was forced to tear down his own house in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukabbir under the same pretext.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

Khalid Abu Tayeh, an activist, told WAFA that Fawaz Abdo embarked on tearing down his own100-square-meter house late Monday evening in the neighborhood to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition on its own.
Abdo said that the demolition of his house, which he built over five years ago, resulted in the displacement of his family composed of six members. 
Wadi Hilweh Information Center, a Silwan-based media center, reported Abdo noting that he had no option but to carry out the demolition after the Israeli municipality rejected his attempt to freeze the demolition order.

"Israeli forces demolish agricultural shed south of Hebron""",12/1/20 11:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122196,"
HEBRON, December 1, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished an agricultural shed in Zif village, southeast of Hebron city, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees Fuad al-‘Amour told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to the Tal Zif archaeological site, in the south Hebron hills, where the heavy machinery tore down an agricultural shed belonging to some Palestinian families in the diaspora, citing the structure’s proximity to a settler-only bypass road as a pretext. 
Meanwhile, Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Popular Committees Rate al-Jabour confirmed that Israeli forces stormed Zif village, where they demolished a cave and seized a mobile house.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"House foundation, well demolished by Israel in the south of the West Bank""",11/30/20 11:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122182,"
 
HEBRON, Monday, November 30, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today demolished the foundation of a house under construction and a well to the north of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli forces stormed Jabal al-Jumjuma area, located between Halhoul and Sair towns, north of Hebron, where they destroyed a well built to collect rainwater and demolished the foundations of a house in the early stages of construction under the claim they were built without a permit.
In the previous few months, Israeli settlers stormed the same area, which overlooks the bypass road 60, and raised Israeli flags on it as they shouted slogans calling for seizing the entire area.
The settlers’ intrusions into the site were carried out under the protection of Israeli forces, who frequently set up checkpoints leading to the site and fenced it off with barbed wire as a means to deny Palestinians access to their property at the location.
Meanwhile, Halhoul mayor Hijazi Mireb noted that the Israeli occupation authorities have been supporting settlers’ attempts to seize Jabal al-Jumjuma as a means to further fragment the territorial contiguity of Hebron district.
He said the Halhoul and Sair municipalities have cooperated in preparing a road to the site in order to facilitate access of area farmers to their land and to reclaim it. 
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve demographic and territorial control of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers and therefore justifies building thousands of housing units for Jews only in the dozens of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.

"Israel detains five Palestinians during funeral of alleged attacker in East Jerusalem""",11/30/20 11:26,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122181,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, November 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation force last night detained five Palestinian youths as they were participating in the funeral in East Jerusalem of an alleged Palestinian attacker.
According to the Wadi Hilweh Information Center, Israeli forces assaulted participants in the funeral of Noor Shuqeir, from Silwan neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, whose body Israel agreed to turn over to his family after placing strict conditions for his funeral.
The forces used sound bombs against the youths and prevented them from reaching the cemetery where Shuqeir was being buried before detaining five of them.
The Center added that the soldiers also set up a barrier at the road leading to Lions’ Gate, which leads to the cemetery and prevented people from accessing the area.
Israeli authorities only allowed up to 20 people of Shuqeir’s family to attend his funeral after confiscating their phones.
Shuqeir, 36, was shot dead on Wednesday at a checkpoint east of Jerusalem after soldiers claimed he attempted to carry out a car-ramming attack, which his family and lawyer say was not true since Israel would not normally release the body of Palestinians killed in attacks.

"In a surprise move, Israel decides to turn over the body of an alleged Palestinian attacker to his family""",11/29/20 20:34,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122168,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, November 29, 2020 (WAFA) – In a surprise and unusual move, the Israeli occupation authorities agreed today to turn over the body of a Palestinian man it claimed its soldiers have killed after he attempted a car-ramming attack to his family for proper burial.
Mohammad Mahmoud, an attorney with the Prisoners Affairs Commission, said Israel has agreed to turn over the body of Noor Shuqeir, from Silwan neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, to his family after placing strict conditions for his funeral.
He said the body will be handed over tonight to his family at 10:00 in the evening local time at a police station in Jerusalem, to be taken immediately to Makassed Hospital and then to be buried in the family cemetery with the participation of only 30 people, of whom 20 will be allowed to reach the cemetery. The participants in the funeral will not be allowed to raise flags, banners or shout slogans during the funeral and the family was forced to post a $3000 fee to guarantee that it will abide by the police orders.
Shuqeir, 36, was shot dead on Wednesday at a checkpoint east of Jerusalem after soldiers claimed he attempted to carry out a car-ramming attack.
Mahmoud said the fact that the police has agreed to turn over Shuqeir's body to his family proves that he was killed without reason and that he did not attempt the car-ramming attack as claimed because normally Israel would withhold bodies of alleged Palestinian attackers for a long period of time and use them as a bargaining chip in any future prisoners exchange deal with Palestinian organizations.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, November 29, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli municipality of occupied Jerusalem demolished today a stairway leading to one of the gates of al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the city, local sources said.
Witnesses told WAFA that an Israeli bulldozer demolished the stairway leading to the Lions’ Gate under the pretext that it was used to transfer equipment to al-Yusifiya Islamic cemetery, which is close to the aforementioned gate.
In the meantime, surveyors of the Israeli municipality began to survey the cemetery's land and fixed signs there. The reason for demolishing the stairway or what happened in the area remains unknown.
Israeli authorities had announced earlier that they would place concrete pillars for a cable car project, which they intend to establish near Jerusalem’s Old City all the way to the Mount of Olives. The project overlooks the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

TEL AVIV, Saturday, November 28, 2020 (WAFA) – An Israeli convoy of around 100 vehicles made its way to Jerusalem on Saturday afternoon demand the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over long-running corruption charges revolving around the so-called submarine affair.
The submarine affair revolves around allegations of a massive bribery scheme involving a multibillion-shekel government purchase of naval vessels from German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp. 
According to Israeli media outlets, the convoys set off from the upscale town of Caesarea near Netanyahu’s private residence and Bilu junction near Rehovot, with vehicles bearing Israeli flags and makeshift submarine and F-35 models on top of the cars. Over 100 vehicles were taking part.
The protest convoy was led by the Black Flag movement, a group that has organized the weekly Saturday protests in front of the Israeli Prime Minister’s residence in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the country for the past six months.
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial is scheduled to enter its evidentiary phase in January.
Several of Netanyahu’s close aides as well as high-ranking military officials were already indicted for the submarine case, but not the premier himself.
For about six months, thousands of Israelis have taken the streets of central Jerusalem near Netanyahu’s residence, calling on him to step down. Protesters say Netanyahu should not remain in office when he is on trial for corruption charges and accuse him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis.

"Israeli settlers uproot grape saplings near Ramallah""",11/27/20 17:11,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122144,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, November 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Extremist Israeli settlers today uprooted about 400 grape saplings belonging to Palestinians in the village of Turmus-Ayya, to the north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, according to witnesses.
They said a group of hardcore Israeli settlers raided the outskirts of the village and uprooted 400 grape saplings in a new attack targeting the livelihood of the local Palestinian population. The attacking settlers also destroyed an irrigation network and cut off seven olive trees belonging to local Palestinian villagers.
Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities. It includes arsons of property and mosques, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

QALQILIA, Friday, November 27, 2020 (WAFA) – At least four Palestinians were injured today, one of them critically, after Israeli occupation forces attacked dozens of activists protesting in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near the city of Qalqilia in the occupied West Bank, against the Israeli colonial settlements.
Morad Shtewi, coordinator of the popular resistance in the village, said Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring four of them. One of the four injured, an 18-year-old teenager, was reportedly hit by a rubber-coated bullet in the head and was rushed to a nearby hospital, where his condition was described as critical.
The other three cases were moderate, and were treated at the scene by local medics.
Soldiers also fired teargas canisters and stun grenades at the protesters, causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation. 
For years, the village of Kafr Qaddum has been at the heart of a national campaign protesting against the Israeli colonial settlement activities in the occupied West Bank. Almost every day and especially on Fridays, clashes erupt between Israeli occupation forces and Palestinian protesters in the village.

NABLUS, November 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-settlement-construction rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, injuring several protestors and causing dozens others to suffocate, according to witnesses.
They confirmed that a large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend the villagers’ lands threatened with confiscation, northeast of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction. 
Soldiers fired tear gas canisters, stun grenades and rubber-coated steel bullets towards the participants, causing dozens to suffocate and injuring seven with rubber-coated steel bullets. 
The village has become the scene of weekly protests against the Israeli occupation authorities’ move to construct and expand colonial settlements at the expense of Palestinian land.
Such events came in the wake of the construction of a new settlement outpost on the territories of the village. Settlers installed an animal barn, extended water pipelines to supply the new outpost with water, and built a several-kilometers road, causing damage and seizing hundreds of donums of the villagers’ land. 
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

RAMALLAH, Friday, November 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Palestinian protestors were injured as Israeli forces today quelled an anti-settlement rally in Kafr Malik village, east of Ramallah, according to witnesses.
They confirmed that a large Israeli military force intercepted the rally called for to defend the villagers’ lands threatened with confiscation at Ras al-Tin and Ein Samiya spring to make room for the construction of a new Israeli colonial settlement outpost, stopping the protestors at the eastern entrance of the village.

NABLUS, Wednesday, November 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of fanatic Israeli settlers Wednesday stormed the archeological site in the town of Sebastia, north of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, local sources said.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that dozes of settlers barged their way into the site under heavy protection by Israeli soldiers, who fired tear gas and sound bomb during the raid.
He added that settlers have been calling their followers to carry out regular intrusions into the site, aiming to seize it.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

NABLUS, Wednesday, November 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians suffered from injuries Tuesday night after being assaulted by an extremist Israeli settler near the village of Jinsafut, east of the occupied West Bank city of Qalqilia, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that an Israeli settlers attacked and sprayed two Palestinians with pepper near the village, inflicting bruises across the bodies.
Daghlas identified the two casualties as Wael Sultan, a resident of the Salfit-district village of Hares, and Na’im Ghanem, a resident of the Nablus-district village of Sarra.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.

"Israeli forces demolish two structures south of Hebron""",11/25/20 10:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122110,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, November 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday demolished two structures to the east of Yatta, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local sources confirmed.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees in Masafer Yatta, Fouad al-Amour told WAFA that Israeli military bulldozers tore down the 65-square-meter house of Rasmi Abu Aram in Khirber Ar-Rakeez besides to the 35-square-meter house of Hatem Makhamra in Khirbet at-Tuwani, purportedly for being built without licenses.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces served a demolition order against a health unit in Sarura hamlet, noting that the unit belongs Jalal al-Amour who lives in a cave. 
In November, over 16 demolition orders were served against Palestinian structures in the same area; seven of which have already been carried out.
Al-Amour noted that Israeli forces aim to kick Palestinians out of their lands through demolishing their houses in favor of the expansion of nearby illegal Israeli colonial settlements.

"Israeli forces quell anti-annexation protest in northern Jordan Valley, dozens injured """,11/24/20 14:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122102,"
TUBAS, Tuesday, November 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday afternoon cracked down on an anti-annexation protest heading towards Khirbet Humsa al-Fawqa village, southeast of Tubas, in the northern Jordan Valley, injuring dozens. 
A large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally organized against the Israeli occupation authorities’ plan to annex the site of the demolished village and the larger Jordan Valley. 
Soldiers opened tear gas canisters and concussion grenades on protesters as the latter reached Tayaseer military checkpoint, east of Tubas city, which was closed in advance, causing dozens to suffocate due to inhaling the toxic gas.
four protesters sustained injuries after being directly hit with tear gas canisters in their feet and were treated at the scene. Two others sustained injuries after being struck with tear gas canisters in the head and the abdomen. Both cases were rushed to the hospital.
Israeli troops showered journalists with tear gas canisters at the scene as a means to prevent them from covering the events.
Hundreds of Palestinians participated in a mass protest called for by a number of national factions in support of Khirbet Hamsa al-Fawqa, which the Israeli forces demolished three weeks ago.
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

They confirmed that the soldiers closed the metal gate installed at the town entrance, causing a traffic jam and obstructing Palestinians’ free movement to and out of Ramallah city.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.
Closures besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

RAMALLAH, Tuesday, November 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Wednesday razed Palestinian-owned lands Ras Karkar village, west of Ramallah, to make room for the construction of a sewage pipeline, according to a local sources.
Nu‘man Nofal, a villager, told WAFA that Israeli bulldozers razed the villagers’ land, known as Ras Abu Zaitoun, northeast of the village, in order to install a sewage pipeline for the nearby Israeli colonial settlements.
He noted that Israeli forces opened a dirt road running to his 50-donum plot of land in the same site, fenced it off and set up a metal gate on its entrance about two months ago, denying him access to it unless he has a special military permit.  
He added he managed to reclaim his land last year, planting it with trees, but the Israeli soldiers uprooted most of its trees and razed it.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, said that a group of club-yielding settlers intercepted Palestinian vehicles traveling along the Nablus-Qalqilya Road, close to the entrance of the illegal Yitzhar colonial settlement, notorious for its violent settlers, and attacked them, causing damage to some of them and terrifying the passengers.
Daghlas said the use of clubs is a new phenomenon in the settlers’ violence against Palestinian civilians when previously all the attacks were with rocks.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

TEL AVIV, Saturday, November 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Despite the stormy and chilly weather affecting the region, thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Saturday evening for the sixth month demanding their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down.
Several thousand people gathered outside Netanyahu’s official residence in occupied Jerusalem, the focal point of the months-long demonstrations. A similar crowd of demonstrators protested outside Netanyahu’s private home in the upscale coastal town of Caesarea. Smaller gatherings took place at intersections and overpasses across Israel.
The Black Flags protest movement said hundreds of cars were on their way to demonstrate near the Israeli prime minister’s private home in Caesarea. It also said pro-Netanyahu activists hurled rocks at protesters in the northern community of Shlomi, near the Lebanese border.

"Israeli settlers raid village in south of West Bank, attempt to attack homes of Palestinian residents""",11/21/20 14:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122068,"
HEBRON, Saturday, November 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of hardcore Israeli settlers escorted by soldiers today raided al-Tuwanah, one of the nine hamlets of Masafer Yatta, a Bedouin community located south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Settlers from the illegal settlement of Havat Maon raided the hamlet and attempted to attack homes of the local Palestinian residents while verbally assaulting activists, said Fouad al-Amour, a local activist.
Residents and activists, he said, stood up to and engaged the settlers, resulting in one resident receiving light injuries.
Israeli soldiers who were accompanying the settlers reportedly did nothing to stop the attack and rather provided the settlers with protection.
Attacks by Israeli settlers against vulnerable Palestinian communities is commonplace, and are rarely prosecuted by the occupation authorities.

Deputy mayor of the town Tayseer Abu-Dayak confirmed that a group of Israeli settlers attacked a house on the outskirts of the town, smashing the windows and shouting offensive and insulting slogans against the villagers.
The settlers also vandalized the homeowner’s vehicle, slashing its tires and smashing its windshields. 
They sneaked into the village from the site of the site of the former colonial settlement of Homesh, evacuated in 2005.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.

"Israel to demolish agricultural shed in Bethlehem-district village""",11/19/20 17:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/122045,"
BETHLEHEM, Thursday, November 19, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today delivered a demolition order against an agricultural shed in al-Walaja village, west of Bethlehem, according to a local activist.
Ibrahim Awadallah told WAFA that an Israeli military force stormed the southern part of the village and handed a villager an order to demolish his agricultural shed, purportedly for being built without a license.
Located at a horizontal distance of 5 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem, al-Walaja has a population of some 2,800 and occupies a total area of 4,328 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying 113 dunams and accounting for only 2.6 percent of the village’s total area. This area is classified as Area B. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
An area of 4,209 dunams of the village, accounting for 97 percent, is completely isolated by the section of Israel’s apartheid wall. The majority of this land is agricultural land, forests and open spaces.
The village is flanked by two Israeli colonial settlements; Gilo from the east and Har Gilo from the south. 
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

HEBRON, Wednesday, November 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today closed off  several agricultural roads to the east of Yatta  town, south of Hebron city, according to local sources.
Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Popular Committees, Rateb al-Jbour, told WAFA that Israeli military bulldozers sealed off a number of agricultural roads leading to a cluster of hamlets adjacent to the settler-only bypass Road 60 as well as the road leading to Bani Na‘im town, northeast of Hebron, with earth mounds and rocks.
He added that closing the road aims at preventing Palestinian farmers from accessing their lands and seizing them in favor of colonial settlement expansion.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.
Closures besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, November 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today ordered stop on the construction of four Palestinian houses in Kisan village, east of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to local sources.
Deputy head of Kisan Village Council Ahmad Ghazal told WAFA that Israeli forces raided the village and handed four Palestinians orders to stop the construction of their houses under the pretext of unlicensed construction. 
He added that the village has been a regular target of colonial settlement construction, manifest in the spike in the number of stop-construction orders, land grab and the construction of settler-only bypass roads on lands seized from the village.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.

It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land. 
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

NABLUS, Wednesday, November 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces and settlers Wednesday morning stormed Sebastia town, to the north of the Nablus city, before closing off the town’s archeological site to Palestinians.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that large units of Israeli forces raided the town before proceeding to close off the archeological site to Palestinians to make room for settlers.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Twelve dunums of the archaeological area is located within (B) areas, which are controlled by Israeli military and Palestinian administrative authority, while the other part of the area lies within (C) areas, which falls under complete Israeli administrative and military control.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.

JENIN, Wednesday, November 18, 2020 (WAFA) – A number of Palestinian workers Wednesday morning suffered from suffocation after being attacked by Israeli soldiers near the village of Rummanah, northwest of Jenin city, according to local sources and witnesses.
They told WAFA that Israeli soldiers used a helicopter to fire tear gas bombs towards Palestinian workers as they were on their way to their jobs inside Israel, causing a number of them to suffocate due to inhaling the toxic gas.

"Israel to demolish houses in southern West Bank""",11/17/20 16:16,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/121020,"
HEBRON, Tuesday, November 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today delivered demolition orders against a number of houses to the east of Yatta town, south of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees in Masafer Yatta, Fouad al-Amour, said that Israeli forces posted demolition orders on the external walls of a number of houses in At-Tuwani village and Massafer Yatta, which are both comprised of 22 small localities or hamlets.
The demolition orders were served against brick-and-tin-built shacks and a health unit in At-Tuwani, Ar Rakeez and Sarura hamlets, purportedly for being built without licenses.
Meanwhile, al-Amour confirmed that Israeli forces ordered a halt on the restoration works of a cave to be used to shelter a family in Khirbet al Fakheit, as well as the removal of a water network in Khirbet Asafi.
The soldiers took photos for a number of houses and a local school in Khirbet al Majaz.
Almost a week ago, Israeli forces issued demolition and stop-work orders against several Palestinian structures in Masafer Yatta as a means to forcefully displace the residents and make room for the expansion of the illegal Israeli colonial settlements.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

BETHLEHEM,  Tuesday, November 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Tuesday morning set up a tent on a plot of land belonging to the villagers of Battir, located to the west of Bethlehem city, according to a local source.
Director of the Bethlehem Office of the Anti-Wall and Settlements Commission, Hassan Breijieh, told WAFA that a group of settlers set up a tent on a plot of land, known as al-Khammar, northeast of the town, as a prelude to seize it to serve as the nucleus of a new colonial settlement outpost. 
Breijieh added that the area has become s frequent target for settler intrusions and violations, including setting up caravans and constructing settler-only roads.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

"Israeli forces demolish structure southeast of Tubas""",11/17/20 10:51,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/121009,"
TUBAS,  Tuesday, November 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday morning demolished a residential structure in al-Buqi‘a Plain, southeast of Tubas city, in the northern Jordan Valley, local sources said.
Mutaz Bsharat, an official in charge of monitoring Israeli colonial activities in the Jordan Valley, said that Israeli forces tore down a residential room belonging to Rami Bani-Odeh in al-Buqi‘a Plain.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israeli military infiltrates Gaza border, raze lands""",11/17/20 10:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/121008,"
GAZA, Tuesday, November 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday infiltrated Gaza’s border to the east of Khan Younis city, in the southern coastal enclave, and razed farmlands, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the military vehicles and bulldozers  advanced several dozens of meters to the east of the city, leveled borderline farmlands and erected earth mounds while intermittently opening fire at the site.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"House demolished, land razed in the south of the West Bank""",11/16/20 12:54,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120998,"
BETHLEHEM, Monday, November 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today demolished a Palestinian-owned house and leveled a plot of land in Artas village, southwest of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local official.
Head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission office in Bethlehem, Hassan Breijieh, said that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to Khallet al-Nahleh area of the village, where the heavy machinery tore down an 80-square-meter house and leveled a plot of land belonging to a local resident.
He explained that the owner had title deeds proving ownership of the land.
Breijieh said Khallet al-Nahleh is regularly targeted by Israel due to its location near illegal Israeli settlements, particularly Efrat settlement, and Israel wants to take over Palestinian land in order to link the area settlements together.
Like so many other villages in Palestine, Artas has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations.
Israel has constructed Efrat colonial settlement on most of the village land, while the apartheid barrier took more of its land.

RAMALLAH, Monday, November 16, 2020 (WAFA) –A Palestinian woman subdued this morning at Qalandia checkpoint near Jerusalem was among 16 Palestinians detained today and last night by Israel in the occupied territories, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society.
Israeli occupation forces at Qalandia checkpoint, north of Jerusalem, opened fire in the air and subdued a woman, who was not immediately identified, claiming she was walking in a lane at the checkpoint designated for cars only, which could be by mistake.
The army, that runs the main checkpoint from the West Bank into Jerusalem, closed it immediately and interrupted traffic for a while before reopening it.
There were several previous incidents in which Israeli forces at the checkpoint and other similar ones throughout the occupied territories have shot and either killed or injured Palestinians under different pretexts.
PPS said meanwhile that Israeli occupation forces detained overnight seven Palestinians from the Hebron district in the south of the West Bank, including a 16-year-old boy from Arroub refugee camp, an 18-year-old youth from Beit Ummar, and two brothers from Sair.
Two other Palestinians were detained from the village of Kubar in the Ramallah district.
The Israeli forces also detained six Palestinians from various East Jerusalem neighborhoods, said the PPS.

ANKARA, Monday, November 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Turkey yesterday denounced an Israeli plan to build over 1200 new housing units in an illegal settlement south of Jerusalem, stressing that the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law.
“Israel, which recently approved the construction of 108 additional illegal settlements in East Jerusalem, once again demonstrated that it continues to violate international law and infringe upon the rights of the Palestinian people through its decision on the construction of a new illegal settlement area consisting of 1257 housing units in East Jerusalem,” said a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement.
“It is clear that Israel is trying to prevent the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign State of Palestine by building additional illegal settlements between East Jerusalem and the West Bank,” it said.
Israel yesterday opened bidding for the construction of Givat Hamatos settlement, north of Bethlehem, that would cut the biblical city off occupied East Jerusalem and end prospects for a future contiguous Palestinian state.
“On this day that we celebrate the thirty-second anniversary of the foundation of the State of Palestine, we remind once again that the Palestinian territories belong to the Palestinian people, and we invite all members of the international community which support the vision of a two-state solution, to stand against Israel's aggressive actions,” said the Turkish Foreign Ministry statement.

"Egypt joins the world in slamming Israeli tenders to build 1257 housing units in the occupied territories""",11/16/20 09:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120991,"
CAIRO, Monday, November 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Egypt today joined the world in condemning the Israeli authorities’ decision to offer tenders to build 1257 new housing units in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of related United Nations and Security Council resolutions.
Ahmed Hafez, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement that Egypt is concerned that such policies will undermine chances of a two-State solution, isolate East Jerusalem from its Palestinian environs, and obstruct efforts to end the stalemate in the Palestinian issue.
Israel yesterday opened bidding for the construction of Givat Hamatos settlement north of Bethlehem that would cut the biblical city off occupied East Jerusalem and end prospects for a future contiguous Palestinian state.

"UN: New Israeli settlement would significantly damage prospects for a future, contiguous Palestine""",11/16/20 09:09,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120990,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, November 16, 2020 (WAFA) – United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov, today expressed concern about Israeli plans to build a new settlement in the occupied territories, warning that it would significantly damage prospects for a future, contiguous Palestinian state.
“I am very concerned by the decision of the Israeli authorities yesterday to open the bidding process for the construction of Givat Hamatos,” said Mladenov in a statement.
“If built, it would further consolidate a ring of settlements between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. It would significantly damage prospects for a future contiguous Palestinian State and for achieving a negotiated two-State solution based on the 1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states,” he said.
The UN official reiterated the general world view about Israeli settlement being illegal under international law.
“Settlement construction is illegal under international law and I call on the authorities to reverse this step.”

"Foreign ministry says Israel’s settlement announcement undermines two-state solution""",11/15/20 19:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120987,"
RAMALLAH, Sunday, November 15, 2020 (WAFA) – The Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ministry said today that Israel’s recent settlement announcement is meant to undermine the two-state solution.
In a statement, the ministry condemned the Israeli decision to announce a tender for the construction of 1257 new settlement units southeast of occupied Jerusalem, with the aim of expanding the settlements in that area and link them to Israeli cities.
This a heavy blow to the principle of the two-state solution and the opportunities for implementing it, the ministry said, adding that the Israeli plan undermines the opportunity to establish a viable, geographically connected and sovereign Palestinian state.
“It is quite clear that the occupying power is racing against time to exploit the remaining transitional period of the US President Donald Trump to implement its expansionist colonial projects, which would undermine the chances of achieving peace on the basis of international peace references,” the statement pointed out.
The statement noted that these decisions prove that the occupation state has not stopped for a single moment its policy of land annexation for the purpose of settlement expansion.
The ministry stressed that the countries of the world must shift their stances from condemning such practices to holding Israel accountable for all its crimes against the Palestinian people and their right to their independent and sovereign state.
Israel approved tenders for the construction of 1257 new housing units in an illegal West Bank settlement; located between the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. These new housing units would separate Jerusalem from the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, November 15, 2020 (WAFA) — Israeli occupation forces assaulted today Palestinian workers near Ramallah while they were on their way to their wokplaces inside Israel, and denied them entry, according to a local source.
Imad Khawaja, head of the municipality of Ni’lin, to the west of Ramallah, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers attacked Palestinian workers near the village and assaulted them with teargas, causing many cases of suffocation among them. 
Khawaja added that the workers, who used the same route they use every day in their daily commute to their workplaces inside Israel, were ultimately denied entry and were forced to return to their homes in the West Bank.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, November 15, 2020 (WAFA) — Hundreds of Israeli protesters gathered last night outside the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in occupied Jerusalem in what has become a weekly demonstration calling for the Israeli leader to resign.
Many protesters held Israeli flags or black or pink flags, which the grassroots movements behind the demonstrations have adopted as symbols. But as the rainy winter season has come early, turnout was reported to be lower than in recent weeks.
Smaller demonstrations were also held in Tel Aviv, outside Netanyahu’s vacation home in the seafront town of Caesarea and in other locations across the country.
Israeli media outlets said that prior to the weekly demonstrations last night, at least 18 people were arrested during clashes with police after hundreds of protesters against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marched down a major highway in the center of the country.
The “Crime Minister” organization, one of the groups leading the protests, responded to the arrests, saying they were politically motivated.
Netanyahu has been facing long-running charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His trial is scheduled to enter its evidentiary phase in January.
For over five months, thousands of Israelis have took the streets of central Jerusalem near Netanyahu’s residence, calling on him to step down. Protesters say Netanyahu should not remain in office when he is on trial for corruption charges and accuse him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis.

GAZA, November 15, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes and artillery last night and early today morning carried out a series of strikes on multiple targets across the besieged Gaza Strip, leaving damage to property but no casualties, said WAFA correspondent.
Israeli fighter jets bombed with at least two missiles an outpost east of Rafah city, in the south of the Gaza Strip, leaving significant property damage and causing fire to erupt at the site. A farming land adjacent to the outpost was also bombed. No injuries were reported.
Meanwhile, fighter jets bombed a farm near the border with Egypt, just near the city of Rafah, causing damage to the farm and to neighboring residential facilities but no human casualties.
Israeli warplanes also hit an outpost southeast of the city of Khan Younis, in the south of the Strip, also causing damage to property but no casualties.
In the meantime, Israeli artillery, stationed along the perimeter fence surrounding the Gaza Strip, bombed a farming land near Al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza City and another one near the town of Beit Hanoun, north of the Strip. The artillery strikes left damage to the sites bombed and to neighboring facilities but no casualties.

AMMAN, Saturday, November 14, 2020 (WAFA) – The Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today denounced the continuing Israeli violations of the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the latest of which was allowing Israeli settlers more time to be on the premises of the holy site, one of Islam’s top holy places in the world.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Daifallah al-Fayez said in a statement that allowing entry of Israeli fanatics to the holy compound was a blatant disregard of the historical and legal status quo, which gives Jordan the sole right to run the affairs of the compound and organize Muslim prayers there.  
He demanded Israel to respect the historical and legal status quo at Al-Aqsa Mosque and all its 144-dunum walled compound, which is a purely Islamic holy place, stressing that the Islamic Waqf department, which is a Jordanian government department, is the sole authority responsible for it and for overseeing who enters it.
Al-Fayez called upon the international community to pressure the Israeli occupation to end its provocative policies in Jerusalem and the holy sites in the city.

JORDAN VALLEY, Saturday, November 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities ordered today a number of Palestinian families in the northern Jordan Valley region, the occupied West Bank, to leave their homes to make way for Israeli military training in the area.
Muataz Besharat, who monitors Israeli violations in the area, told WAFA that Israeli army handed notices to a number of families ordering them to leave their homes for several days next week in order to make way for the training.
The Jordan Valley forms a third of the occupied West Bank, with 88 percent of its land classified as Area C, under full Israeli military control.
Nearly 20 percent of the occupied West Bank has been declared ""firing zones"" since the 1970s, but according to the UN, some 80 percent of these areas are not in fact used for military training.
However, when military training takes place, Israel forces families to leave their homes for hours or days at a time until the drill is over.

"Islamic cleric warns against a decision allowing Jewish fanatics more time at Al-Haram Al-Sharif""",11/14/20 15:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120968,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, November 14, 2020 (WAFA) – The Mufti of Jerusalem and Palestine, Mohammad Hussein, today warned against a decision by the Israeli authorities allowing Jewish fanatics more time to be on the premises of Al-Haram Al-Sharif Mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam’s top holy places in the world.
Hussein, the highest Muslim cleric in Palestine, told Voice of Palestine radio that giving the fanatics extra 45 minutes every day to be on the premises of the walled Al-Haram Al-Sharif, which includes Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, “affects the religious, legal and historical status quo” at the Mosque, and that “the fanatics do not hide their intention toward the Mosque.”
He said the fanatics have been openly calling on Israel to take over and run the Muslim holy compound in place of the Islamic Waqf, which is a Jordanian government department that has been in charge of the Muslim compound for generations.
The Mufti expressed concern that Israel is trying to divide Al-Haram Al-Sharif between Muslims and Jews, which could result in serious trouble and religious strife, urging Muslims to be present at their holy site all the time in order to protect it against attempts to change its status as a Muslim-only holy place.

HEBRON, Saturday, November 14, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian farmer in the south of the West Bank refuses to leave his land located near an illegal Israeli settlement despite Israeli army assaults and threats and keeps returning to it.
After last week forcing the farmer, Mohammad Salibi, to leave his land located in the town of Beit Ummar, north of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli occupation forces today returned to find him and his family back working in their land and once again ordered them at gunpoint to leave the area, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said Israeli soldiers ordered the Salibi family members to leave their land while they were harvesting the olive crops, but the family insisted on defying the orders and continued to work in the land located near the illegal settlement of Beit Ain.
This was the second attack by Israeli occupation forces on the Salibi family since last week when the forces attacked members of the family working in the same area despite an Israeli High Court order allowing them to work there.
Attacks by Israeli occupation forces and hardcore settlers on Palestinian farmers often witness a rise during the olive harvest season, which is one of the most important seasons for thousands of Palestinian households in the occupied territories whose income depends heavily on the success of this season.

SALFIT, Saturday, November 14, 2020 (WAFA) - The Israeli occupation forces today placed a metal gate along the apartheid wall on the southern side of al-Zawiya town, west of the northern West Bank city of Salfit, blocking access of area farmers to their lands and the village’s garbage truck to a landfill, according to Mahmoud Mawqidi, mayor of al-Zawiya.
He told WAFA that in order to make access for army vehicles to the new gate, the occupation forces had opened a 200-meter long road from the southern areas of the town, known as Khallet al-Rumaila, that goes through 10 dunums of land, including one dunum owned by al-Zawiya municipality.
Mawqidi said the occupation forces also prevented the municipality’s garbage truck from reaching the landfill located in the same area to unload the garbage and informed them that the landfill was closed.
It is worth noting that last month the occupation forces seized a bulldozer belonging to the municipality of al-Zawiya while it was opening a road leading to Khallet al-Rumaila in order to allow farmers easier access to their lands during the olive harvest season.

Morad Shtewi, coordinator of the popular resistance in the village, said Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring three of them and causing many cases of suffocation from gas inhalation.
He said all of the injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
Soldiers also raided several houses in the village, smashed their windows and mounted their rooftops to fire at civilians, added Shtewi.
For years, the village of Kafr Qaddum has been at the heart of a national campaign of protest against the Israeli colonial settlement activities in the occupied West Bank. Almost every other day, clashes erupt between Palestinian protesters and Israeli occupation forces in the village.

"Dozens suffocate as Israeli forces crackdown on anti-settlement rally east of Nablus""",11/13/20 14:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120959,"
NABLUS, Friday, November 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-settlement-construction rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, causing dozens to suffocate, according to witnesses.
They confirmed that a large Israeli military force violently dispersed the participants of the rally called for to defend the villagers’ lands threatened with confiscation, northeast of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction. 
Soldiers fired tear gas canisters, stun grenades and rubber-coated steel bullets towards the participants, causing dozens to suffocate and injuring a number of others with rubber-coated steel bullets. 
Earlier this month, Israeli forces quelled a tree-planting event that the villagers organized to prevent Israel from seizing their land for the construction of illegal settlements.
Such events came in the wake of the construction of a new settlement outpost on the territories of the village. Settlers installed an animal barn, extended water pipelines to supply the new outpost with water, and built a several-kilometers road, causing damage and seizing hundreds of donums of the villagers’ land. 
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

"Three Palestinians injured from Israeli gunfire in Ramallah""",11/13/20 10:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120953,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, November 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Three Palestinians dawn Friday sustained injuries from Israeli military gunfire in Ramallah city, according to security sources.
They confirmed that Israeli forces raided several neighborhoods of Ramallah city, including Qaddura refugee camp, located next to Ramallah government hospital, known as Palestine Medical Complex, triggering confrontations with local youngsters.
The soldiers fired live bullets, rubber-coated steel bullets and grenades towards protestors, injuring three; one with a live round in the hand and the two others with rubber-coated steel bullets in the feet. 
Soldiers also barged their way into al-Bireh city.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for “wanted” Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Under Israeli military law army commanders have full executive, legislative and judicial authority over 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank. Palestinians have no say in how this authority is exercised.

"Expansion of illegal settlement in north of West Bank continues with takeover and razing of Palestinian land""",11/12/20 13:24,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120943,"
NABLUS, Thursday, November 12, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today leveled Palestinian-owned land to the east of Yanun village, southeast of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, in an ongoing process to expand an illegal settlement built in that area, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement construction in the northern West Bank, said that Israeli army and settlers’ bulldozers were leveling Yanun village land near the illegal settlement outpost known as 777 on the western side of the village to expand area settlements.
He expressed his concerns that the settlements’ expansion would suffocate the village.
Yanun is surrounded by settlements. The majority of its land was confiscated to first build Itamar settlement then Gidonim settlement. In 2000 Israeli settlers controlled the western side of Yanun’s lands to build Givat Alam Afri Ran, and other outposts such as ‘776’, ‘777’, and ‘778’, leaving Yanun with 2000 dunums of which 60 percent is pastoral land. The current land leveling is intended to grab more of Yanun land for the benefit of the settlements.

"Israeli soldiers beat an elderly Palestinian man for refusing to leave his West Bank land""",11/12/20 11:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120941,"
HEBRON, Thursday, November 12, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation soldiers today attacked an elderly Palestinian man after refusing orders to leave his land in Beit Ummar town, north of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Mohammad Awad, an activist, told WAFA that Muhammad Salibi, 77, was harvesting his olive trees in his land near the illegal settlement of Beit Ain, built on Beit Ummar land, when soldiers ordered him to leave the area.
When Salibi refused to heed their orders and proceeded to harvest the olives, the soldiers assaulted him with their guns and forced him to leave his land.
Israel does not allow Palestinian farmers to reach their lands near the illegal settlements that mushroom all over the occupied territories without getting a rarely-issued permit beforehand and then they claim that the land is abandoned and therefore justify taking it over for the illegal settlement expansion.

"Rights groups demand Israeli military end incursions into Gaza’s farmlands, compensate farmers for damages""",11/11/20 14:46,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120928,"
HAIFA, Wednesday, November 11, 2020 (WAFA) – On 13 October, Israeli military bulldozers entered about 300 meters into the Gaza Strip, and severely damaged dozens of dunums of agricultural land, destroying crops and irrigation systems.
According to the Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, this is the most severe damage to Gaza farmlands caused by an Israeli military incursion since 2014. The Gaza Ministry of Agriculture reported that at least 10 farmers' sources of income were harmed as a result of the Israeli incursion, with damages estimated to agricultural lands and crops at more than $32,000.
In response, Gisha – Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, Al Mezan, and Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel sent an urgent letter to the Israeli defense minister, attorney general, and military advocate general, demanding an immediate halt to the military’s destruction of land in the Gaza Strip, an investigation into the recent incursions, and compensation to Gaza farmers for the damage, today said Adalah in a press statement.
The Israeli military has been routinely conducting ground incursions into the Gaza Strip for years. According to the United Nations, the military conducted 42 incursions into Gaza between January and 19 October of this year. Since 2014, Israel has also been conducting aerial spraying of herbicides inside Gaza in order to clear lands and kill vegetation adjacent to the perimeter fence. During this period, Palestinian farmers have been living in constant fear of harm to their sources of livelihood.
Israel has continued to undertake these destructive actions even on the backdrop of the global COVID-19 health crisis and related concerns for the financial situation and food security in Gaza, and in direct violation of its obligation to protect the human rights of civilians in Gaza living under its control.
In response to a request submitted by Gisha under the Freedom of Information Act, the Israeli military said previously that the incursions were required for ""operational needs whose purpose is to protect security.""
Speaking on behalf of the three human rights organizations, Gisha Attorney Muna Haddad emphasizes that such needs do not justify damage to farmland in Gaza.
""These destructive operations violate Israeli and international law, and the Israeli military has no authority to carry them out. These operations endanger farmers’ lives, bodily integrity and property, and as such, disproportionately and grievously violate their most fundamental rights, including the rights to dignity, private property and livelihood,"" said Haddad.

Coordinator of the Protection and Steadfastness Committees in Masafer Yatta, Fouad al-Amour, told WAFA that the occupation forces handed five demolition notices in Khirbet al-Twani and Khirbet al-Rakiz, against residential structures and water wells under the pretext that they were built without a permit.
He said that Israeli forces took pictures of several structures in the hamlets, which raised concern among residents that they might be next in the demolition and displacement.
During the last week, the occupation forces delivered several demolition notices and tore down a number of structures in Masafer Yatta as a means to forcefully displace the local residents and make room for the expansion of the illegal Israeli colonial settlements.

BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, November 11, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli occupation forces today  seized a herd of camels in the eastern slopes of Bethlehem governorate, according to a local  source.
Head of Arab al-Rashayida village, southeast of the city, Fawaz al-Rashaydah told WAFA that Israeli troops chased the herd for a long distance starting from al-Ubeidiya town, east of the city, till Arab al-Rashayida, and seized nine of them, citing the designation of the area as a nature reserve as a pretext.
The herd`s owners, identified as Salameh al-Rashayida and Mohammad Walayida, were informed that they would be able to get back their camels on the condition that they pay 3,500 shekels (some USD $ 1,050) for each camel – 26,000 shekels ($9,450) in total. 
Al-Rashaydah added that livestock and cattle breeders in the village  are often subjected to military and settlers’ attacks and harassments, including seizing tents, livestock and vehicles as well as imposing fines, as a means to forcefully displace them and make room for the expansion of nearby Israeli colonial settlements.
Designating an area as a nature reserve may convey the impression that Israel wishes to protest the environment. In practice, however, Israeli has been using such designations for advancing the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, November 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces quelled a rally marking the sixteenth anniversary of late President Yasser Arafat in Tuqu‘ town, east of Bethlehem, causing a number of suffocation cases, according to a local municipal source.
Tuqu‘ Mayor Tayseer Aby Mifreh said that the students of the local boys school organized a rally to commemorate the 16th anniversary of the death of Arafat, who died in Paris on November 11, 2004 and was flown back to Ramallah for burial.
Israeli troops cracked down on the rally, which set off from the school, in an attempt to disperse it, causing a number of students to suffer from tear gas suffocation. 
All students and teachers were evacuated from the school campus, which was surrounded by Israeli soldiers.
Gatherings commemorating the sixteenth anniversary of Arafat’s death are scheduled to take place today across various parts of the occupied territories, with a major rally to be held at Arafat Mausoleum in the afternoon, though attendance may be limited due to Covid-19 outbreak.
Fatah spokesman Munir Jaghoub said that due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s rally is going to abide by the regulations of the Ministry of Health.

"Israel demolishes carwash workshop in Jerusalem-district town""",11/10/20 11:06,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120905,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, November 10, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today demolished a Palestinian-owned carwash workshop in Anata town, northeast of Jerusalem, according to local sources.
They said that Israeli forces raided the town from the southern entrance, where they tore-down the carwash claiming it is located in the vicinity of the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Pisgat Ze’ev and unlicensed.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
Rights groups have long pointed out that Israel’s discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem – which include routine home demolitions, discriminatory allocation of building permits, and the eviction of Palestinians from their homes for the benefit of Israeli settlers – are aimed at driving out Palestinians from the city.

He said that Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers advanced dozens of meters to the east of the city, razed borderline farmlands, and erected earth mounds while firing smoke shells.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel still maintains control over its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, November 8, 2020 (WAFA) – The Palestine News and Information Agency (WAFA) said in a report today it has documented 17 violations committed by the Israeli occupation forces against journalists and media institutions working in the occupied Palestinian territories during last October.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, November 1, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israelis are demonstrating on Saturday night in squares, junctions and on bridges around the country for the 20th week in a row, calling on him to step down over long-running criminal corruption charges and mishandling of the coronavirus crisis.
Israeli media outlets said more than 2,000 protesters gathered in the central protest site, located in Jerusalem's Paris Square, just outside Netanyahu’s official residence on Balfour Street. Smaller demonstrations also took place elsewhere across the country.
The protests were resumed last week after a month-long lockdown which had allowed gatherings only within one kilometer from people's homes. But last week, restrictions were lifted and the mass protests resumed, mainly in occupied Jerusalem.
For almost five months, thousands of Israelis have been demanding Netanyahu to step down, saying he is unfit to lead Israel while he is on trial for corruption charges. The Israeli premier has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes for his role in a series of scandals.

Soldiers opened fire at the man, who was identified as Ammar Zaid, and injured him in his shoulder, after he neared the Israeli Segregation Barrier which passes near the village. He was moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
Israeli occupation forces have a long record of opening fire at Palestinian civilians for the mere suspicion of threatening the lives of soldiers, even when no evidence is available.

The injured were treated at the scene by local medics.
For more than 15 years years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

"Israeli forces crackdown on anti-settlement rally east of Nablus""",11/6/20 14:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120865,"
NABLUS, Friday, October 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-settlement-construction rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, injuring a number of participants, according to local sources.
They confirmed that a large Israeli military force, escorting a bulldozer, raided the village to disperse the participants of the rally called for to defend Palestinian-owned land threatened with confiscation, east of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction. 
Soldiers fired tear gas canisters and stun grenades towards the participants, causing a number to suffocate, and beat others, including Khairi Hannoun.
Hannoun, 61, made headlines in August after Israeli soldiers beat him and threw him to the ground as he participated in an anti-settlement and land grab protest in Shufa village, south of Tulkarm, while a soldier pressed his knee on his neck while on the ground, a scene reminiscent of the event that led to the death of African-American George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while detaining him on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers restricted Palestinian movement through Beit Furik checkpoint, preventing more people from reaching Beit Dajan and taking part in the rally. 
Earlier this month, Israeli forces quelled a tree-planting event that the villagers organized to prevent Israel from seizing their land for the construction of illegal settlements.
Such events came in the wake of the construction of a new settlement outpost on the territories of the village. Settlers installed an animal barn, extended water pipelines to supply the new outpost with water, and built a several-kilometers road, causing damage and seizing hundreds of donums of the villagers’ land. 
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

"Settlers storm archaeological site north of Nablus """,11/6/20 12:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120864,"
NABLUS, Friday, November 6, 2020 (WAFA) – For the second consecutive day, hundreds of Israeli settlers today stormed the archaeological site of Sebastia, north of Nablus city, according to a municipal source.
Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azzem told WAFA that hundreds of settlers forced their way into the site under the protection of the Israeli military, which declared the site off-limit for Palestinians.
He added that the site has become a scene for daily settler targeting and encroachments, particularly following the opening of a Palestinian tourist project, known as Bydar Project, and hoisting a large Palestinian flag.
Azzem said also that Israel has been trying to force the municipality to remove a large Palestinian flagpole, installed as part of a UNESCO-supervised rehabilitation project conducted in Sebastia’s public plaza in the area classified as Area B, under the pretext the flag provokes the settlers, whose presences in the village and at the site is also a provocation to the Palestinian residents.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.

"Israeli forces detain two Palestinians, ransack houses in Jenin""",11/6/20 11:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120863,"
JENIN, Friday, November 6, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday morning detained two Palestinians and ransacked a number of houses in Jenin district, according to local sources.
Fatah official Hussein Jaradat confirmed an Israeli military raid in Zububa village, surrounded by Israel’s wall on three sides, northwest of Jenin city, where soldiers broke into a number of houses, close to the wall, interrogated occupants and collected information on them. 
The soldiers did so purportedly in search of a number of youths suspected of cutting a part of Israel’s fence close to the houses.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces rounded up two Palestinians after ransacking their families houses in a raid that triggered confrontations in Jenin refugee camp. 
Located 10 kilometers to the northwest of Jenin city, Zububa has a population of 2,450 (2020 census) and its area spanned over 15,400 dunams before the Nakba, a term used to describe the tragedy Israel’s establishment has inflicted upon the Palestinian people in 1948. 
Since the Nakba, the village has experienced gradual land grab. According to the United Nations, the village lost some 18,000 dunums across the Green Line, some 2,000 dunums in 1959 and 26 dunums in 1999 to construct the Salem DCL and military base. That same year, thirty-three dunums was also confiscated to build a trench, one and a half meters wide and two meters deep along the Green Line.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, isolating some 250 dunums of the village’s land, some 50 to 80 meters on the Zububa side of the Green Line, and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, covering no more than 1,500 dunums, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations. 
The area of the land seized and/or separated by the wall exceeds 1,700 dunums as estimated by the Applied Research Institute of Jerusalem (ARIJ). During the course of the wall construction, some 1,500 olive and almond trees were uprooted.

"Euro-Med Monitor welcomes EU statement on Israeli demolitions of Palestinian structures""",11/5/20 21:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120861,"
GENEVA, Thursday, October 05, 2020 (WAFA) – The Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor (Euro-Med) today welcomed the European Union's call on Israel to halt the demolition of Palestinian structures.
""We warmly commend the EU’s call on Israel to halt its demolitions of Palestinian structures in the occupied territories – including of EU-funded structures – as the rate of such demolitions has alarmingly been hitting a record high this year,"" Euro-Med said in a statement. ""What’s needed from the EU next is to take concrete action and exert adequate pressure on Israel to stop such grave violations.""
Earlier today, the spokesperson of the European External Action Service issued a statement that denounces Israel’s demolition of more than 70 Palestinian structures in Khirbet Hamsa al-Foqa, in the northern Jordan Valley. The statement warned that there are currently 52 Palestinian schools under threat of demolition and called for “the protection of children, including ensuring their right to education in a safe and secure school environment.” The EU reiterated that in light of the humanitarian impact of the current coronavirus pandemic, Israel should halt those demolitions.
“The EU’s statement is a positive acknowledgement of the seriousness and severity of the growing demolitions of Palestinian structures amid the Coronavirus pandemic,” said Ramy Abdu, Euro-Med Monitor Chairman, “what’s needed now is translating this strong position into meaningful policies and actions that put an end to Israel’s unconstrained violations of international law.”
For the last two months, Euro-Med Monitor’s team has been intensively campaigning for a strong EU position on the escalated and accelerated Israeli demolitions of Palestinian structures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under Israeli military rule, including structures funded by the EU and its member states.
In October, Euro-Med Monitor delivered a policy memo directly to several EU lawmakers that detailed the significance of Israel’s assault on Palestinian presence in Area C and East Jerusalem. The memo noted that despite the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying economic crisis, Israel has been significantly stepping up its demolitions of Palestinian structures, including EU-funded projects, where the period from March to August 2020 saw the highest average destruction rate in four years. “Israel doesn’t only seek to undermine and disincentivize EU-funded structures, it aims to eliminate them altogether,” the memo emphasized.
Disputing Israel’s pretext for demolishing Palestinian structures as “lacking permit,” Euro-Med Monitor detailed its documentation of how Israel does not permit construction and development for Palestinians in Area C, not even a linking up to the water and electricity grids. “Israel has deliberately made such permits nearly impossible for Palestinians or internationals to obtain, with only as few as 2.3% of applications for building permits in Area C approved by Israeli authorities between 2009 and 2012.”
The Memo further noted that Euro-Med Monitor’s team has documented some instances in which Israel demolished and confiscated EU-funded power grids and equipment that were installed in coordination with Israel’s civil administration in the first place.
Euro-Med Monitor recommended in its policy memo that the EU should articulate a clear and consistent position on demolitions and destruction of EU-funded projects; demand compensation from Israel for EU-funded projects that get destroyed; and continue to invest in Palestinian development, but substantively penalize the Israeli government when European-funded projects are targeted.
“We are glad to see the EU taking such a clear position against those demolitions, however, only concrete actions rather than rhetorical denunciations can bring those violations to an end,” Abdu concluded. “As Israel’s largest trading partner, the EU is both morally responsible and politically capable of putting an end to the Israeli assault on Palestinian rights.”

NABLUS, Thursday, November 05, 2020 (WAFA) – The Sebastia archeological site in the north of the West Bank was today declared by the Israeli army off-limit to Palestinians while made accessible to Israeli settlers only, according to Sebastia mayor Mohammad Azem.
He told WAFA that a large unit of Israeli occupation forces stormed the village of Sebastia and prevented access for Palestinian residents to the archeological site.
He added that dozens of Israeli settlers, under Israeli army protection, were allowed access to the Palestinian archeological site, a situation that recurs often.
Azem said also that Israel has been trying to force the municipality to remove a large Palestinian flag hoisted in the village, which is classified as Area B according to the Oslo accords, that is under Israeli military control and Palestinian civilian administration, under the pretext the flag provokes the settlers, whose presences in the village and at the site is also a provocation to the Palestinian residents.

"Palestinian youth to support farmers during olive harvest season """,11/5/20 11:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120847,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, November 05, 2020 (WAFA) - Through its Civil and Democratic Participation of Palestinian Youth Programme, ActionAid Palestine (AAP) supported Palestinian youth initiatives seeking to help Palestinian farmers and show solidarity with them during olive harvest in the Bethlehem-district village of Walajeh and the Tulkarem-district village of Shweikah.
The programme, implemented in partnership with the Alternative Information Center (AIC) and  Al-Awda Center for Childhood and Youth, also aims to promote the role of youth in strengthening the resilience of farmers in their lands.
These advocacy activities implemented by the youth aim to highlight the effect of Israeli colonial settlements and barrier on the lives of Palestinian and their livelihoods. They also shed the light on the humanitarian consequences on farmers due to restricted access to land, confiscation of water sources, restricted access to markets, livelihoods and effect of settlers' violence on security and physical safety of farmers.
The 24 attacks documented by OCHA, which took place between October 7th and 19th, resulted in the injury of 23 Palestinian farmers, the damage and burning of over 1,000 olive trees, and the theft of large amounts of produce.
Olive products are an essential component of Palestinian culture and economy. According to Palestinian official figures, there are more than 12 million olive trees planted across the West Bank, making the olive harvest “one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.”
The olive oil industry reportedly supports the livelihoods of more than 100,000 Palestinian families and accounts for a quarter of the gross agricultural income of the occupied territories.
Raneem , a Palestinian young woman who volunteered in olive picking in Walajeh, said: “this participation is important since it strengthens our affiliation with land. Land and olives symbolize our case, which the Israeli occupation tries to damage using different means.”
Reflecting on his participation in helping farmers pick their olives, Muhannad, a Palestinian youth, said: “We aim to strengthen the resilience of the Palestinian farmers and send a message stating that we are here to stay, and this is our land.”
Shareef Shaheen is a youth community activist from the south of West Bank. He also participated in the olive picking in Walajeh. Reflecting on his participation, he said: “we participate in olive harvest to support the residents of Walajeh and we are here to stay like the existence of olives.”

"Humanitarian Coordinator: West Bank witnesses largest demolition in years""",11/4/20 21:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120843,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, November 04, 2020 (WAFA) - Yesterday, 73 people, including 41 children, were displaced when Israeli authorities demolished their homes and other structures and destroyed belongings in the Palestinian community of Khirbet Hamsa al-Fawqa, today said Yvonne Helle, the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim for the occupied Palestinian territory.
Three quarters of the community’s population lost their shelters, making this the largest forced displacement incident in over four years, she said in a statement.
Humanitarian agencies visited the community and recorded 76 demolished structures, more than in any other single demolition in the past decade. The destroyed properties – including homes, animal shelters, latrines and solar panels – were essential to, livelihoods, wellbeing and dignity of community members, whose rights have been violated, said Helle. Their vulnerability is further compounded by the onset of winter and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the demolished structures had been donated as humanitarian assistance.
So far in 2020, 689 structures have been demolished across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, more than in any full year since 2016; rendering 869 Palestinians homeless. The lack of Israeli-issued building permits is typically cited as a reason, even though, due to the restrictive and discriminatory planning regime, Palestinians can almost never obtain such permits. Demolitions are a key means of creating an environment designed to coerce Palestinians to leave their homes, said the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim.
Located in the Jordan Valley, Hamsa al-Fawqa is one of 38 Bedouin and herding communities partially or fully located within Israeli-declared ‘firing zones.’ These are some of the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank, with limited access to education and health services, and to water, sanitation and electricity infrastructure.
""I remind all parties that the extensive destruction of property and the forcible transfer of protected people in an occupied territory are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. While assuring that the humanitarian community stands ready to support all those who have been displaced or otherwise affected, I strongly reiterate our call to Israel to immediately halt unlawful demolitions,"" said the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim.

by Al-Hareh Al-Husni
JORDAN VALLEY, Wednesday, November 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Life of people in Khirbet Hamsa al-Fawqa in the northern Jordan Valley was going on normally and as usual, at least until yesterday at noon when things changed when as bulldozers of the Israeli occupation authorities leveled to the ground dozens of structures owned by the Palestinian families.
In the beginning, the extent of the demolitions was not clear even though initial reports talked about ""unprecedented"" demolitions taking place in the area.
It became clear later, according to the documentation of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, that the occupation authorities have demolished nearly 70 structures, including residential housing units, barracks, sheep sheds, and solar panels for 11 Palestinian families composed of 60 people.
In addition, the occupation forces seized tractors, water tanks, and vehicles for residents of Khirbet Ibziq in the northern Jordan Valley.
Human rights activist Aref Daraghmeh described what happened in Khirbet Hamsa as “a new nakba (catastrophe)” for its people who live off raising livestock and benefit from the open plains to provide free food for their livestock.
""They destroyed everything for us,” said Nizam Abu Kabbash, one of the residents, as he was going through the rubble. “Now life has no meaning.”
Anas Awawdeh, another person affected by the demolitions, says: ""I have never seen anything like this in the 10 years that I lived in the place.""
""Level them to the ground."" This is what Awawdeh heard an Israeli army officer telling the driver of the bulldozer.
The head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, Walid Assaf, told WAFA that what happened was a policy of scorched land, and that the occupation was pursuing a policy of total demolition of Palestinian communities in order to empty the land.""
It was possible to see all the tents and structures leveled to the ground, with the exception of tents that were provided last night by human rights organizations and the Red Cross for the afflicted families.
But Abu Kabbash said that the tents did not accommodate everyone and that some of them spent their nights in their private vehicle.
This was echoed by Awawdeh, who told WAFA reporter that he had to send his children and his wife to relatives in a faraway place, noting that there were no indications of the demolition and that it all happened suddenly at noon.
""They picked a time before the rain came,"" he said. ""We live here a difficult life and this night was one of our worst nights.""
The sky was covered with clouds and there was rainfall as the residents were working on retrieving their stuff.
The Israeli human rights center B’Tselem says that for decades, the occupation authorities have implemented a policy aimed at displacing these communities by creating a living reality that is difficult to bear, and pushing people to leave their homes ""as if it was of their own free will.""
According to B'Tselem, there are approximately 2,700 people living in about 20 communities in the Jordan Valley, on lands, or on the outskirts of lands that the army declared firing zones. The occupation authorities seek, by various means, to prevent people from continuing to reside in the area, and among those means is the demolition of their homes repeatedly.

"Israeli military to conduct drills in northern Jordan Valley""",11/4/20 13:05,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120833,"
TUBAS, Wednesday, November 04, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli military today notified several Palestinian communities in the northern Jordan Valley to evacuate their houses in preparation for military drills, according to a local official.
Mutaz Bisharat, a Tubas governorate official, said that Israeli forces stormed al-Farisiya, al-Burj and al-Mayta villages, and ordered at least 14 families to evacuate their homes on next Tuesday and Wednesday, citing the need to carry out military drills as a pretext.
Soldiers also ordered a villager to evacuate his home and remove his tents in al-Farisiya, purportedly to make room for tanks during the drills.
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israeli occupation forces kill Palestinian near major West Bank checkpoint""",11/4/20 11:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120832,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, November 04, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today killed a Palestinian near Huwara military checkpoint, south of Nablus city, according to local sources and witnesses.
They confirmed that Israeli forces shot a Palestinian driving a white Hyundai near the checkpoint at point-blank range, first injuring him before he was declared dead.
The Palestinian was identified as 29-year-old Bilal Adnan Rawajbeh from Iraq Tayeh village, east of Nablus. He served as a legal advisor holding the rank of a captain in the Preventive Security Forces, one of the Palestinian Authorty’s security services. 
Rawajbeh was left to bleed to death by the Israeli soldiers who closed the checkpoint in both directions and prevented Palestinian medics from approaching the scene.
The Israeli military said in a brief statement that they “thwarted” what they described as an attempted shooting attack” by “neutralizing the assailant”, and noted that no soldier was hurt.
There was no official Palestinian information on the incident, and circumstances surrounding it remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Many Palestinians were injured or killed in similar incidents under the pretext of alleged stabbing attempts.
Israeli has been criticized for its reflexive use of lethal force and “extrajudicial killings” when Palestinian alleged attackers no longer pose an immediate threat. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that circumstances surrounding such killings over the past months remain disputed.
Various international, Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations have slammed Israel’s policy of “extrajudicial killings” against Palestinians.

"Israeli bulldozers level, demolish structures in Jerusalem neighborhood""",11/3/20 12:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120817,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, November 3, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli municipality of Jerusalem today leveled and demolished several Palestinian-owned structures and land in Beit Hanina and Jabal al-Mukabbir neighborhoods, according to a media center and witnesses.
The Wadi Hilweh Information Center reported that Israeli police escorted a bulldozer into Beit Hanina neighborhood, where the Hyundai heavy machinery leveled a plot of land.
Police also forced their way into Jabal al-Mukabbir neighborhood, where they used a bulldozer to demolish a horse shed and destroyed a cement floor. 
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Settlers plant Palestinian land with trees south of Nablus""",11/3/20 12:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120816,"
NABLUS, Tuesday, November 03, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today planted Palestinian land belonging to As-Sawiya village, south of Nablus city, with trees as a means to forcefully seize it, according to a local activist.
GhassanDaghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, confirmed that a group of settlers from the nearby colonial settlement of Rechalim, notorious for its religious fanatic community, are planting the villagers’ land in the vicinity of the settlement with trees as a means to seize it.
He added that the settlers had uprooted hundreds of trees from this land several years ago and were attempting to create a fit accompli through setting up tents and fencing Palestinian-owned land close to the settlement, which indicates their intention to further expand the settlement.
The village has been a scene of frequent settler attacks, including chopping down dozens of olive trees and wooden electric poles as well as vandalizing utility networks, as it is the case with other Palestinian villages and towns in Nablus and Salfit districts, which have the largest concentration of colonial settlements.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli military infiltrates Gaza border, level farmlands""",11/3/20 11:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120815,"
GAZA, Tuesday, November 3, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military today infiltrated Gaza’s border to the east of al-Bureij refugee camp in the central besieged strip and leveled farmlands, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of the camp, and proceeded to raze borderline farmlands and erect earth mounds while opening fire.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

TUBAS, Tuesday, November 03, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today seized Palestinian-owned tractors and solar panels from Khirbet Ibziq village, north of Tubas city, in the northern Jordan Valley, according to a municipal source.
The village mayor Abdul-Majid Khdeirat confirmed that a large number of Israeli forces barged their way into the village and prevented the villagers from leaving their houses as they conducted a house-to-house search operation. 
The raid resulted in the confiscation of a number of Palestinian-owned vehicles, tractors and solar panels.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.

"Israel’s ‘Silicon Valley’ settlement plan to be built on the ruins of dozens of Palestinian businesses""",11/2/20 15:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120808,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, November 02, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today approved the destruction of dozens of Palestinian businesses in Wad al-Joz neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem as part of a plan to construct a new settlement on their ruins called “Silicon Valley,” a step that has raised concern and anger of the Palestinian businesses in the area, most of them have been there since before the Israeli occupation in 1967.
The Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem has advanced the plan for the technology park, the Silicon Valley or Wadi Silicon, which would result in the confiscation of 2,000 dunums of Palestinian-owned land and the demolition of over 200 Palestinian shops, restaurants and facilities such as car repair and parts shops, in the neighborhood to make room for the construction of some 900 hotel rooms.
The 2.1-billion shekels ($600 million) project, first made public on June 3, allocates 250,000 square meters to “real estate for high-tech companies” as well as further 100,000 square meters split between “shopping centers” and “hotels”. It falls within the “East Jerusalem City Center” master project, approved by the Israeli occupation’s planning and zoning committee in April.
The project will also see the construction of new roads, a light rail and a settler park near Kedron Valley to the south of the city.
The Israeli authorities have served eviction notices to dozens of Palestinian facilities and shops, allowing them until December 30 to leave before the demolitions are carried out.
Palestinians have warned of the risks of the project, which would further isolate their neighborhoods in Jerusalem, allow Israel to take over some 2,000,000 square meters in sensitive areas, and ultimately alter the city’s landscape and erase the Arab and historic character of its markets and business districts.
Contrary to Israel’s claims that the project would serve them and improve their conditions, Palestinians slammed the project saying it serves to bolster the Judaization of the occupied section of the city and paves the way for settlers’ takeover of Palestinian lands and businesses.
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) official Hanan Ashrawi has said that “Israel‘s focused and systematic plunder of occupied Jerusalem persists unabated, in violation of international law and proclaimed positions of states worldwide.”
“In addition to a sharp increase in home demolitions and the displacement of many families in Jerusalem during the COVID-19 pandemic, the illegal Israeli ‘municipality’ has unveiled its plans to demolish decades-old Palestinian industrial area in the Wad al-Joz neighborhood and replace it with a gentrified settler neighborhood with the flashy name of ‘Silicon Wadi’,” she wrote.
“This is an outrageous and criminal plan that will devastate 200 Palestinian businesses in the area and deprive hundreds of Palestinians of their sources of livelihood. It is a massive scheme that brings Israel’s displacement and replacement policy against the Palestinian people into sharp focus, especially in Jerusalem.”
The approval came as Israel proceeds with preparations to annex large swaths of the West Bank in line with the US-touted Mideast plan, which treats Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and endorses Israel’s longstanding policy of permanent occupation, colonialism and apartheid over the Palestinian people.

NABLUS, Monday, November 02, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces early today demolished a house in the village of Rujeib, to the east of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, after alleging that the house owner has killed an Israeli, according to sources.
Mufeed Dweikat, head of the Rujeib village council, told WAFA that a large military unit of Israeli soldiers accompanied by a bulldozer raided the village in the early morning hours and proceeded to demolish the two-story house of Khalil Dweikat, noting that the Israeli authorities have issued the demolition order back in August.
The soldiers forced the Dweikat family out of the house and left them in an open area on a rainy and cold night.
The village mayor said clashes erupted between the youths and the Israeli forces resulting in one youth getting shot with a rubber-coated steel bullet while others suffered from suffocation due to inhaling tear gas fired at them by the soldiers.
Khalil Dweikat was arrested and charged with killing an Israeli man in the town of Petah Tiqwa in August.
Israel demolishes homes of Palestinians who kill Israelis as a collective punishment policy against the entire family. This policy does not apply to Israelis who kill Palestinians in terror acts.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, November 1, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israelis demonstrated last night outside the official residence of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him to step down over long-running criminal corruption charges and mishandling of the coronavirus crisis.
Protesters waved Israeli and pink flags, which have become a symbol of the protest movement, as they marched through Jerusalem toward a square near Netanyahu’s official residence. Smaller demonstrations also took place elsewhere across the country.
In recent weeks, the protests were reduced due to a month-long lockdown that allowed gatherings only within one kilometer from people's homes. But last week, restrictions were lifted and the mass protests resumed, mainly in occupied Jerusalem.
For almost five months, thousands of Israelis have been demanding Netanyahu to step down, saying he is unfit to lead Israel while he is on trial for corruption charges.
Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes for his role in a series of scandals.

He said that one of the landowners, Mohammad Salibi, had an Israeli court order allowing him to fence his land to protect it from attacks by settlers, and yet every time he goes to work on his land he is attacked by either soldiers or settlers or both at the same time in an effort to get him to stay away from that land.

RAMALLAH, Saturday, October 31, 2020 (WAFA) – On his 97th day of hunger strike demanding his release from prison, Palestinian administrative detainee in Israel, Maher al-Akhras, is in critical condition, today said prisoners’ advocates.
Hassan Abed Rabbo, from the Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs Commission, told WAFA that al-Akhras may experience a sudden relapse in one of his vital organs due to deficiency of salts and fluids in his body, and his refusal to take nutritional supplements.
He said al-Akhras, who is being kept at Kaplan hospital in Israel, suffers from severe fatigue and began to feel pain in his heart. His hearing and speech are affected, he suffers from seizures, severe pain all over his body, and from blurred vision and severe headache.
Abed Rabbo said there is a real concern that this will affect the vital functions of his body organs, such as kidneys, liver and heart, and therefore his life is at risk at any moment.
Al-Akhras, 49, a father of six, is from the northern West Bank city of Jenin. He was detained on July 27 and slammed with a four-month administrative detention order without any clear charges and based on secret evidence not available even to his lawyers.
He immediately went on hunger strike demanding his release from prison.
Attempts by his attorneys to have him spend the rest of his detention period at a Palestinian hospital have so far failed to yield results with the Israeli High Court insisting to keep him at an Israel hospital while refusing to end his illegal detention.

HEBRON, Friday, October 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation soldiers assaulted and beat up a Palestinian woman and her son today while detaining the latter in the city of Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Soldiers, who were escorting a group of rampaging Israeli settlers while attacking Palestinian homes east of Hebron, detained Mohammad Aref Jaber, 17, and brutally assaulted him and his mother as she tried not to let the soldiers take her son.
The eastern neighborhoods of Hebron are frequently exposed to attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers from the illegal settlement of Kiryat Arbaa, illegally built on Palestinian lands east of Hebron.

"Israeli forces crackdown on anti-land-grab rally east of Nablus""",10/30/20 13:57,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120769,"
NABLUS, Friday, October 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today cracked down on an anti-land-grab rally in Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, injuring dozens of participants, according to WAFA correspondent.
She said that Israeli troops, who raided the village, opened fire on Palestinians participating in the anti-land-confiscation rally to disperse them, injuring three participants with rubber-coated steel bullets and causing dozens others to suffocate.
The rally was called for to defend Palestinian-owned land threatened with confiscation, east of the village, to make room for Israeli colonial settlement construction. 
Earlier this month, Israeli forces quelled a tree-planting event that the villagers organized to prevent Israel from seizing their land for the construction of illegal settlements.
Such events came in the wake of the construction of a new settlement outpost on the territories of the village. Settlers installed an animal barn, extended water pipelines to supply the new outpost with water, and built a several-kilometers road, causing damage and seizing hundreds of donums of the villagers’ land. 
Located 12 kilometers to the east of Nablus city, Beit Dajan has a population of some 4,700 and occupies a total area of 44,100 dunams, including 360 donums of built-up area for the villagers. A large part of the village lands were seized for the construction of Al-Hamra and Mekhora (Mehola) colonial settlements, east and southeast of the village, in 1971 and 1973.
The village depends on grains plantation and fruitful trees, such as olive, figs and almonds.

"Settlers vandalize water, electricity networks south of Nablus""",10/30/20 12:42,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120768,"
NABLUS, Friday, October 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers dawn Friday vandalized water and electricity networks in As-Sawiya village, south of Nablus city, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, confirmed that a group of settlers sneaked their way into the village, and chopped down a number of wooden electric poles using chainsaws.
The settlers, who came from the nearby colonial settlement of Rechalim, notorious for its religious fanatic community, also destroyed part of the water network in the western part of the village.
The village has been a scene of frequent settler attacks, including chopping down dozens of olive trees on several occasions, as it is the case with other Palestinian villages and towns in Nablus and Salfit districts, which have the largest concentration of colonial settlements.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are over 800,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

One of the teens was identified as Mohammad Zubeidi, 16, whose father, Zakaria, was a leading member of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Fatah’s armed wing, during the second intifada but was later given amnesty by Israel in a deal reached with the Palestinian Authority. His condition was described as moderate.
Another teen, also aged 16, sustained moderate injuries from bullet shrapnel that hit him in the back. The other one, aged 15, was hit and seriously injured with a live bullet in the head.

"Palestine seeks UN pressure to secure return stolen ancient baptismal font """,10/29/20 14:00,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120760,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, October 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Palestine today demanded the United Nations to pressurize Israel to return a stolen rare Byzantine-era baptismal font. 
Palestinian Permanent Delegate Ambassador to UNESCO Mounir Anastas demanded that the UN organization’s Committee of the Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property to pressurize the Israeli occupation government to return the stolen baptismal font that was stolen by the Israeli military from Tuqu‘ town, southeast of Bethlehem, in last July.
Speaking to Voice of Palestine radio this morning, Anastas said that the subcommittee convened to discuss several issues, including the illicit transfer of cultural property by the Israeli occupation authorities from the Palestinian territories, over the past two days.
He added that he delivered a speech to the committee, condemning Israeli actions regarding the illicit transfer of Palestinian cultural property and demanding the Israeli occupation authorities to return the stolen font to its original place and urging the UNESCO to insert a permanent item on its agenda to discuss the illicit ownership of cultural and historical property.
On July 20, Israeli soldiers used a forklift truck to steal the stone-made font, which dates back to the fifth or sixth century A.D., from the town.
A documentary prepared by Jerusalem’s Christian Media Center reveals that the rosy font, which weighs approx. eight tons, was part of a local Byzantine-era church.
The font was seen placed for long at the site of the ancient church in Khirbet Tuqu‘, the ancient town of Tuqu‘, before being stolen by unauthorized dealers using a huge forklift in 2000.
In 2002, Tuqu‘ Municipality managed to retrieve the font and placed it in the vicinity of the mayor’s house, pending the construction of a local museum.
The stolen 1500-year-old receptacle is one of three rare baptismal fonts hewn in rosy rock. The two others include the one recently discovered at the Church of the Nativity and another belonging to Beit Jubrin Church.
Israel has frequently stolen and acquired ancient artifacts from the occupied territories through unauthorized dealers and looters.
Israel has been using archeology as a key tool in reinforcing its bogus territorial claims to historic Palestine, including “Judea and Samaria”, the Jewish nationalist name used to refer to the occupied West Bank, and give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.

He told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces stormed the neighborhood in the early hours and handed several Palestinian households demolition notices against their homes under the pretext that they were built without a permit.
He said that occupation forces also took over the rooftop of several houses and took pictures of the homes and buildings in the neighborhood, which is usually a prelude to demolishing them.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, October 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli municipality bulldozers today demolished a Palestinian-owned building is Sur Baher town, south of Jerusalem, according to a media center. 
The Silwan-based Wadi Hilweh Information Center reported that Israeli police and municipal staff cordoned off a two-storey building in the town, emptied the stores in the first storey of their contents and stormed the apartment in the second floor before the apartment was demolished by two bulldozers.
The apartment, which belonged to Mohammad Tarshan, was demolished purportedly for unlicensed building.
Meanwhile, police and municipal staff stormed Issawiya neighborhood, where they served demolition and stop-construction orders against several buildings.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, October 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Wednesday morning demolished three Palestinian-owned structures near Abu Dis town, southeast of Jerusalem, according to a local activist.
Head of the Land Defense in the Sawahra Younes Ja‘far said that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to the road linking the As-Sawahira Ash-Sharqiya town to Nabi Mousa archeological site, near Abu Dis, where the heavy machinery tore down a 30-square-meter residential structure belonging to Shaker al-Sarkhi.
He added that the soldiers also tore down another residential structure belonging to Ismael Hathalin near Tahada 2 School in al-Mintar area in the As-Sawahira wilderness.
Meanwhile, Mohammad Hijazi, a nonviolent activist, confirmed that the soldiers also demolished a residential structure belonging to Omar Suleiman in Wadi Abu Hindi, a Bedouin encampment located in the valley squeezed between the Israeli colonial settlements of Maale Adumim and Qedar, east of Abu Dis town.
Ja‘far pointed that all Palestinian Bedouin communities in the Jerusalem wilderness are permanently threatened with eviction and demolition, which will stifle Palestinian population growth, to make room for the construction of colonial settlements.
The community is only accessible through a bumpy dirt road. The population suffers from the poor quality of the road, mainly in winter, as the rain prevents the movement of the area residents completely.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

He is reported to have difficulty in his vision, inability to stand and pain all over his body.
There is concern that his vital organs may stop functioning as he refuses to take food supplements.
Al-Akhras, from the Jenin area in the north of the West Bank, was detained on July 27 and slammed with a four-month administrative detention order. He immediately went on hunger strike in protest against his illegal incarceration.
Efforts are still underway to get an Israeli High Court order which clearly announces an end to his administrative detention, instead of only suspending it in return for ending his hunger strike, as has been the case so far prompting al-Akhras to reject the deal.

BETHLEHEM, Sunday, October 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today delivered orders to demolish two Palestinian-owned houses in al-Maniya village, southeast of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, according to a municipal source.
Head of al-Maniya village council, Zeyad Kawazba, told WAFA that occupation forces stormed the village and handed military orders to demolish two houses allegedly for being built without Israeli permits.
The houses, each occupying an area of some 180 square meters, belong to two brothers identified as Essa and Assaf Froukh, and are currently inhabited by their families.
Kawazba said the occupation forces gave the two brothers a deadline of 96 hours to carry out the demolition.
The area where the demolition is scheduled to take place is located in Area C, the more than two thirds of the occupied West Bank under full Israeli military and administrative control, and where the occupation authorities do not issue any construction permits to the native Palestinian population. 
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Area C, forcing many Palestinians to embark on construction without obtaining a permit in order to meet their housing needs.

RAMALLAH, Saturday, October 24, 2020 (WAFA) –  A Palestinian farmer sustained a moderate injury in his head today when a group of rampaging hardcore Israeli settlers attacked the village of Asira al-Qibliya, to the south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to the village’s mayor.
Hafez Saleh said settlers from the illegal settlement of Yitzhar, nearby, attacked homes of Palestinians on the outskirts of the village and pelted them with stones, injuring a Palestinian man with a rock in his head. The man, identified as Abdulbaset Ahmad, was moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
Saleh added that clashes erupted between local Palestinian residents and Israeli occupation forces who accompanied the settlers in their attack.
The settlement of Yitzhar is notorious for its hardcore Jewish settler community who in the past committed several attacks against Palestinians and their property, including arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Settler vandalism of Palestinian property in the occupied territories is almost a daily occurrence, and attacks by settlers are rarely prosecuted by Israeli occupation authorities.

NABLUS/HEBRON, Saturday, October 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers vandalized olive trees in the north of the West Bank and chased and attacked Palestinian herders in the south, according to activists.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement and settlers’ attacks in the north of the West Bank, said residents of Jaloud village, south of Nablus, where shocked when they reached their land this morning to see a number of olive trees, some of them hundreds of years old, have been sawed and vandalized.
He said the trees were located in lands close to the illegal Israeli settlement of Eish Kodesh.
In the south of the West Bank, settlers chased and attacked shepherds in an area east of Yatta as they were herding their sheep in the open fields, according to Rateb al-Jabour, coordinator of the popular and national committees in the south of Hebron.
The settlers were backed by soldiers, who claimed the shepherds were herding in what they alleged to be “state” land, he said.
Jabour also said that settlers apparently from the illegal Beni Hefer settlement, east of Hebron, have moved into two tents they had set up on land belonging to the village of Birin in a clear step to take over the land and establish a new illegal settlement outpost.
He said the settlers want to push the Palestinian residents of Birin out of their lands and homes in order to expand their settlement.

"Palestinian vehicles pelted with stones south of Nablus, two injured""",10/23/20 15:49,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120688,"
NABLUS, Friday, October 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian vehicles in Burin town, south of Nablus city, injuring two, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, confirmed that a group of settlers pelted a number of vehicles with stones inside the village, smashing their windshields and injuring three Palestinians.
The casualties were rushed to a hospital for urgent treatment.
The settlers vandalized the house of one of the town residents, causing material destruction.
Confrontations erupted as the town residents attempted to fend off the settler attack, during which three more residents sustained injuries.
The town has been the scene of frequent settler attacks, cutting down fully grown olive trees, setting fire to fields and crops, stealing the olive harvest and attacking olive harvesters and foreign volunteers. 
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
There are over 700,000 Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only colonial settlements across the West Bank in violation of international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly bans the relocation of the occupying nation's civilian population to the land of the occupied.
The occupying state of Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights following the 1967 war, and has since built hundreds of illegal Jewish-only settlements throughout the occupied territories.

"Israeli warplanes strike Gaza sites""",10/23/20 08:42,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120684,"
GAZA, Friday, October 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes dawn Friday stroke two sites in the central and southern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that Israeli fighter jets targeted a site in Nuseirat refugee camp, northeast of Deir al-Balah city, in the central besieged enclave, as well as a plot of farmland, east of Khan Younes city, in the southern strip, causing material damage, but no human casualties. 
Israel claimed that it had struck the sites in retaliation to two rockets fired into southern Israel.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

JENIN, Wednesday, October 21, 2020 (WAFA) – As a punitive measure, the Israeli occupation forces sealed shut early this morning a room in the house of an alleged Palestinian attacker in Yabad town, to the south of the northern occupied West Bank city of Jenin, Palestinian security and local sources said.
They told WAFA that the soldiers raided the house of 49-year-old Nathmi Abu Baker and sealed shut the room he uses in the house.
Israel accuses Abu Baker of the killing of an Israeli soldier who was killed by a rock dropped on his head during a predawn army raid of Yabad on May 12.
He has denied all charges against him, stressing that he had nothing to do with the killing of the soldier.
The army sealed 40 square meters of the 70 square meter house with a special material that is easily flammable and can cause cancer, which deemed the entire house unlivable, according to Ahmad Abu Baker, a family member.
He said the entire family, comprised of nine people, has literarily been displaced and became homeless with the heavy damage and health hazard done to not only Nathmi’s bedroom but the entire house
The sources said the soldiers turned a few houses in the neighborhood where the Abu Bakr house is located into military bases as they proceeded to seal the room and at one point assaulted a local resident, also from the Abu Baker extended family.
The occupation authorities informed the Abu Baker family a few days ago of their intention to seal shut Nathmi’s bedroom.

"Concerned for the life of hunger-striking Palestinian prisoner Maher al-Akhras, human rights organizations demand his release""",10/20/20 14:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120650,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, October 20, 2020 (WAFA) - Maher al-Akhras, in his 86th day of hunger strike in protest of his administrative detention, is at great risk of death, today said four Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations, demanding his immediate release.
A Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) volunteer doctor visited al-Akhras on Friday, and noted that although he is generally lucid, he is also periodically confused, very dizzy, cannot move his legs, stand, or change position in bed. His vision and hearing are rapidly deteriorating and he complains of severe chest pains. According to international medical consensus on hunger strikes, al-Akhras may die any day, said the four organizations.
Al-Akhras, has been on hunger strike since 27 July 2020 following his administrative detention. He has appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court demanding to be released, but the court decided not to cancel his administrative detention – leaving that decision to the security apparatus. Instead, the court only suspended his administrative detention, despite his deteriorating situation, which may result in his death. Al-Akhras is simultaneously prevented from leaving Kaplan hospital in Israel, where he is currently held, and is therefore under de-facto arrest. These court decisions were, interalia, made on incorrect translations of a video of al-Akhras.
Al-Akhras has expressed distrust towards the Kaplan medical team, as occurs often in hunger strikes. He refuses any treatment or medical tests and monitoring from the medical team. He has confirmed that should he lose consciousness, he does not want to receive any medical intervention. It is worth mentioning that current legislation in Israel allows medical staff to feed a person on hunger strike by force, a position which is both unacceptable according to medical ethics and, according to international law, may amount to torture.
Al-Akhras’s case highlights the continued and excessive use of administrative detention in Israel: a procedure that allows the Israeli military commander to hold detainees indefinitely based on secret information without revealing the allegations against them or putting them on trial. The courts who review administrative detention orders do so based on information presented to the court ex-parte by the security agencies, and Palestinian detainees are often jailed for months and even years without formal charges or a trial.
Israel currently holds over 300 Palestinians in administrative detention, contrary to the Geneva Convention, which demands that this practice be used only in exceptional circumstances and subject to strict procedural safeguards. In 2016, the UN Committee Against Torture recommended that Israel, “urgently take the measures necessary to end the practice of administrative detention and ensure that all persons who are currently held in administrative detention are afforded all basic legal safeguards” In 2012, the EU reiterated its longstanding position on Israel's use of administrative detention without charge; detainees, 'have the right to be informed of the reasons for their detention and be subject to a fair trial without undue delay.'
“We call on the international community to urge Israel to allow al-Akhras to, at the very least, move to a hospital in the West Bank, so he may be treated by a medical team in which he has trust or release al-Akhras immediately before it is too late.

NABLUS, Tuesday, October 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today flooded Palestinian-owned land with sewage and wastewater in Sebastia town, north of Nablus city, according to a municipal source.
Mayor of Sebastia Mohammad Azzam confirmed that settlers from the illegal colonial settlement of Shavei Shomron were responsible for flooding Palestinian-owned land in the western section of the town with sewage and wastewater, disrupting the olive harvest.
He explained that the land is planted with olive and apricot trees, which means that farmers are incurred with heavy material losses.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Settlers kick Palestinian farmers out of their lands near Nablus""",10/20/20 11:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120645,"
NABLUS, Tuesday, October 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today kicked Palestinian farmers out of their land Deir al-Hatab village, located to the east of Nablus city, local sources said.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers assaulted Palestinian farmers as the latter were picking their olive trees to the north of the village, and kicked their out of their lands.
The assailants came from the illegal Israeli settlement of Elon Moreh.
Yesterday, settlers flooded lands belonging to the villagers with wastewater, damaging their olive trees as people are engaged in the olive harvest.
With more than 12 million olive trees planted across 45% of the West Bank’s agricultural land, the olive harvest constitutes one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.
According to UN OCHA, the olive oil industry supports the livelihoods of more than 100,000 families and accounts for a quarter of the gross agricultural income of the occupied territories.
But, as local NGO MIFTAH notes, “olive trees carry more than an economic significance in the lives of Palestinians. They are not just like any other trees, they are symbolic of Palestinians’ attachment to their land.”
“Because the trees are drought-resistant and grow under poor soil conditions, they represent Palestinian resistance and resilience. The fact that olive trees live and bear fruit for thousands of years is parallel to Palestinian history and continuity on the land.”

"Settlers set up cattle shed in northern Jordan Valley""",10/20/20 11:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120644,"
THE JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, October 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers last night set up a cattle shed to the west of the illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Maskiyot in the northern Jordan Valley.
Aref Daraghmeh, a local activist, told WAFA that settlers set up the cattle shed to the west of the settlement, where they kept a number of cows.
He slammed the move as part of the settlers’ “silent policy of eating up more Palestinian land”.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

RAMALLAH, Monday, October 19, 2020 (WAFA) - The Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology today condemned the decision to grant the Israeli telecommunications company, Bezeq, a license to operate in the occupied West Bank, considering it a step to undermine and sabotage the Palestinian economy and its control over its airwaves.
It accused the Israeli occupation of taking many measures to impede the development of the Palestinian telecommunications and information technology sector, including allowing the Israeli telecom companies to illegally cover all Palestinian areas and market their modern services to the Palestinian customers taking, as a result, a large share of the market from the Palestinian companies ranging between 20% and 30% according to the reports of the World Bank and the International Quartet Office, which puts Palestinian companies in front of the illegal and unequal competition.
In addition, Israel manipulates the Palestinian airwaves and illegally establishes communication towers in the Palestinian territories in contrast to bilateral and international agreements.
The Ministry called on international organizations to intervene and stop these Israeli measures, stressing that it will not hesitate to pursue legal action to put an end to this continuous encroachment on the Palestinian territory and market.

He told WAFA that the municipality ordered the demolition of the houses under the pretext they were built without a permit, noting that there are also unauthorized houses taken over and illegally inhabited by Israeli settlers in the same area but did not receive demolition orders.
Abu Diab said that the Palestinian houses were built over 10 years ago and are inhabited by 76 people, mostly children and women.
Israel considers Silwan as the City of David and is in a rush to turn it into an Israeli Jewish neighborhood after expelling its Palestinian residents.

WAFA reporter said that one of the guards of the colonial settlement of Yakir, located north of the town, attacked him and his colleagues as they were attempting to report on settlers’ encroachment on a plot of land, upon which settlers have built a swimming pool.
WAFA teams headed to the land with Amer Abu Hijleh, owner of the plot the settlers have encroached upon.
However, the arm-toting guard of the Israeli settlement summoned settlers and uniformed soldiers to the scene in an effort to prevent the reporting byWAFA team and expelled them from the land.
Israeli forces held Abu Hijleh and the team for an hour and warned them against accessing the land once again purportedly for being classified as a closed military zone.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.

NABLUS, Sunday, October 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Extremist Israeli settlers today razed plots of land in the village of Urif, to the south of the occupied West Bank of Nablus, local sources said.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that fanatic settlers used heavy machinery to raze lands near the illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar, located near the aforementioned village.
He added Israeli soldiers provided protection for settlers who were razing the land.
Extremist Israeli settlers’ violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law.
All settlements across the West Bank are illegal under international law, particularly article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which establishes that the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.

HEBRON, Sunday, October 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces tore down today a residential tent housing a Palestinian family in Masafer Yatta, a Bedouin locality to the south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Foad Omour, a local activist who monitors Israeli violations, told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces raided the area and tore down a tent belonging to a local Palestinian man identified as Morad Hamamdeh.
He said the man had set up the tent after the occupation forces demolished his house by the end of last September, under the pretext of lacking an Israeli construction permit.
The area where the home is slated for demolition is classified as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank where Israel retains military and civilian control.
Palestinians living in this area are frequently exposed to the danger of home demolitions by the occupation authorities under the pretext of lacking an Israeli permit.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, October 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israelis demonstrated outside the official residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night, resuming the weekly protest against him after coronavirus restrictions were eased.
The protesters gathered in central occupied Jerusalem and marched to Netanyahu's official residence, holding banners calling on the embattled premier to ""go"" and shouting ""revolution"".
Two rallies were also organized in Tel Aviv and Holon, while scores of smaller demonstrations were also held across Israel demanding the embattled premier to step down.
Israeli media quoted many protesters as saying that they were assaulted by pro-Netanyahu protesters, with injuries reported in a number of areas.
Protesters had previously been prevented from traveling farther than 1,000 meters from their homes in order to protest, and had been allowed to protest in groups of no more than 20.
The protesters say Netanyahu must resign, saying he is unfit to lead Israel while he is on trial for corruption charges.
They also say he has mishandled the coronavirus crisis, which has sent unemployment soaring.
Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes for his role in a series of scandals. He has denied the charges and has said he is the victim of a conspiracy by overzealous police and prosecutors and liberal media.

He said one of the wounded was moved to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.

WAFA correspondent said soldiers verbally assaulted and beat up participants demonstrating at Route 60, which passes near the locality, and briefly detained one of them, said to be a 75-year-old man, in order to disperse their nonviolent protest.
Rateb Jabour, a local anti-settlements activist, told WAFA that the protest was organized in response to the growing Israeli colonial settlement activities in the area and against Israel’s decision to confiscate 360 hectares of Palestinian-owned land in the locality for the benefit of the illegal Israeli settlements. 
He said the land confiscation order aims at expanding the built-up area of the nearby illegal Israeli settlements of Maon, Carmel and Havat Maon. The land to be confiscated belongs to about 10 local Palestinian families, Jabour added.

NABLUS, Saturday, October 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today vandalized around 30 olive trees in the northern West Bank village of Qaryout, south of Nablus, as the olive harvest season in Palestine is at its peak, according to a local official.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors the illegal Israeli settlement and settler activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that the settlers sneaked into the land during the night and cut the olive trees owned by a local farmer causing him a serious loss of badly needed income.
The olive harvest season is one of the most important income-generating work for thousands of Palestinian families most of them suffering from difficult economic hardships.
Israeli settlers and the occupation army often join hands in sabotaging this season for the Palestinians living under occupation.

RAMALLAH, Saturday, October 17, 2020 (WAFA) – After 83 days of hunger strike, Palestinian administrative detainee in Israel, Maher al-Akhras, 49, is said to be in critical health condition, according to prisoners' advocacy groups.
Al-Akhras, from Silat al-Dahr village south of the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was detained in July and slammed with four-month administrative detention without charge or trial and based on secret evidence not known even to his lawyer.
Immediately after his detention, al-Akhras went on an open-ended hunger strike to protest his administrative detention, which could be renewed for indefinite periods of time and which has been deemed illegal by international law, demanding his release from prison to be with his wife and six children again.
Several legal attempts by his lawyers to secure his freedom, including going to the Israeli Supreme Court, have failed.
Today, according to the advocacy groups, al-Akhras is kept at an Israeli hospital following a serious deterioration in his health. He is reported suffering from severe fatigue, pain in the joints, abdomen and stomach, headaches, loss of weight, loss of balance and inability to walk. His hearing and speech seem to have been affected as well by his long fast.
Concern is high that the fast could eventually affect his vital organs such as kidneys, liver and even heart, which could threaten his life and he could die at any moment.
Al-Akhras has told the groups from his sickbed that he will not end his hunger strike short of securing his release.
Several Palestinians held in administrative detention have previously secured their release only after going on a long hunger strike.

RAMALLAH, Friday, October 16, 2020 (WAFA) – At least three Palestinians were injured today when Israeli occupation forces attacked farmers and volunteering activists joining them in harvesting olives in the village of Burqa, to the east of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
Minister Walid Asssaf, Chairman of the Apartheid Wall and Colonization Resistance Commission, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds, teargas canisters and stun grenades at the farmers and activists to disperse them, injuring three of them.
Many others also sustained suffocation from teargas inhalation.
The event was called for by the Commission in response to Israel's denial of access of Palestinian farmers to their olive-planted farms in the area during the last few days, as well as in response to a series of recent attacks by Israeli settlers on the said area during the last week. 
Assaf confirmed that more similar events will be organized in the coming days in an effort to reinforce the resilience of Palestinian farmers in the face of the Israeli attempts to expropriate more Palestinian land for the benefit of the colonial settlement project.
Attacks by Israeli forces and settlers on Palestinian farmers always witness an increase during the annual olive harvest season.

TUBAS, Friday, October 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities announced yesterday their takeover of about 11,000 dunums of (1,000 hectares) of Palestinian land in the northern Jordan Valley region in the occupied West Bank, according to a Palestinian official. 
Qasem Awwad, a spokesman of the Palestinian Authority's Apartheid Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, said the Israeli confiscation order comes under the pretext of transferring the property of the said land to three natural reservoirs in the area, a pretext that Israel has used sometimes to serve the illegal settlement construction and expansion project.  
Awwad said most of the land confiscated is located in areas adjacent to the illegal settlements of Rotem, Maskiyot, and Mesovah, which proves that the reason for confiscation is expanding the built-up areas of the Israeli settlements rather than allocating more land for the natural reservoirs.
The official added that since the announcement of the US-sponsored Deal of the Century plan in January, Israeli occupation authorities approved the construction of over 12,000 housing units in the West Bank settlements.
Earlier this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to annex the entire Jordan Valley region to Israel's sovereignty if he was re-elected as prime minister.

JORDAN VALLEY, Thursday, October 15, 2020 (WAFA) – Three months after Israeli settlers had seized Palestinian land in the occupied northern Jordan Valley and planted it with trees, the settlers today set up a caravan on that land, which is a prelude to establishing an illegal settlement outpost, according to a local rights activist.
Aref Daraghma, who is active in the Jordan Valley against Israel’s settlement plans, told WAFA that the settlers had set up a caravan in Khirbet Ehmair in al-Farisieh village.
He said the settlers have seized that land some three months ago, planted it with trees to create a fait accompli and built a water reservoir and shack before returning today to place a caravan on the land, which indicates their intention to bring more mobile homes to that area and set up a new illegal settlement.
Israel has been forcing Palestinians to leave their lands and homes in the Jordan Valley in favor of Israeli settlement activities and an intention to eventually annex the Jordan Valley.

"UN official says he is concerned about situation of hunger-striking Palestinian prisoner in Israel""",10/15/20 12:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120583,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, October 15, 2020 (WAFA) – The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov today expressed concern about the situation of Palestinian hunger striker in Israeli jail, Maher al-Akhras, after completing 81 days of fast.
Mladenov’s office told WAFA that the Special Coordinator has called on Israel to either charge al-Akhras, specify a time for his imprisonment, or immediately set him and all administrative detainees free.
He said his office regularly calls on Israel to release administrative detainees.
Al-Akhras, 49, from the Jenin area in the north of the West Bank, started an open-ended hunger strike to protest his administrative detention when he was detained in July. After 81 days of hunger strike, there is a deep concern for his health.
Israel’s widely condemned practice of administrative detention allows the incarceration of Palestinian activists without charge or trial for renewable intervals ranging between three and six months based on undisclosed evidence that even a detainee’s lawyer is barred from viewing.
The US State Department has said in past reports on human rights conditions for Palestinians that administrative detainees are not given the “opportunity to refute allegations or address the evidentiary material presented against them in court.”
Amnesty International has described Israel’s use of administrative detention as a “bankrupt tactic” and has long called on Israel to bring its use to an end.
Palestinian detainees have continuously resorted to open-ended hunger strikes as a way to protest their illegal administrative detention and to demand an end to this policy, which violates international law.
There are currently over 350 Palestinians held in administrative detention in Israel for their political activities against the occupation.

Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, confirmed that a group of settlers sneaked their way into the eastern part of the town, where they  chopped down a number of wooden electric poles with chainsaws, causing power blackout in the area. 
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Settlers start work on settler-only road southwest of Nablus""",10/14/20 13:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120563,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, October 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Wednesday morning started the groundwork for the construction of a settler-only road on Palestinian-owned land to the southwest of the occupied West Bank city of Nablus.
Hafez Saleh, a villager of Asira al-Qibliya town, told WAFA that a group of armed settlers escorted a bulldozer to his plot of land in the eastern section of the town, where they heavy machinery proceeded to level his land for the construction of a road that would connect colonial settlements with one another.
He noted that he, with the help of other villagers, was able to stop the bulldozer from proceeding with the land leveling.
The town is bordered by Yitzhar colonial settlement, notorious for its hardcore Jewish settlers.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land, extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, and to build roads, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, while it much more easily gives over 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 53-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Israel to remove residential tent in northern Jordan Valley""",10/14/20 13:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120562,"
JORDAN VALLEY, Wednesday, October 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities Tuesday night notified a Palestinian of removing his residential tent in al-Farisiya village, east of Tubas city, in the northern Jordan Valley, according to sources.
Motaz Bisharat, the Palestinian Authority's official in charge of monitoring Israeli colonial settlement activities in the Jordan Valley, told WAFA that Israeli forces handed Raddad Daraghmeh a notice to demolish his residential tent in the village.
Meanwhile, Aref Daraghmeh, a human rights activist, confirmed that Israeli forces chased and briefly detained two Palestinian shepherds as they were grazing their livestock in Ein Sukkot in the northern Jordan Valley.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

They said that Israeli forces impounded a road grader owned by the municipality that was working on flattening the road leading to the olive groves west of the town, and briefly detained the town’s mayor Mahmoud Mawqadi, who was supervising the work, and the grader driver.
This came in parallel with a surge in Israeli forces and settlers’ attacks against Palestinian olive harvesters across the West Bank.
With more than 12 million olive trees planted across 45% of the West Bank’s agricultural land, the olive harvest constitutes one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.

BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, October 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers stole the olive crops in al-Jabaa village land, southwest of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, and cut branches of trees, today said the head of al-Jabaa village council Diab Mashaleh.
He told WAFA that al-Jabaa villagers discovered when they reached their land that settlers from the illegal Beit Ain settlement have stolen their crops from about 100 dunums of land owned by some 30 people and that the settlers have also chopped branches of the trees.
He said the landowners have been trying to reach their lands for a while but that the army prevented them from getting there telling them that they should obtain a special permit first from the Israeli military government.
When the farmers finally were able to reach their lands after getting army permission, they discovered the theft of their crops and the vandalism of the trees.
Nevertheless, said the village mayor, and despite having a permit from the Israeli army to reach their lands, settlers attacked the farmers and forced them to leave the area under the threat of weapons.

"Israeli settlers attack Palestinian olive harvesters near Ramallah, injure two""",10/13/20 11:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120549,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, October 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today attacked Palestinian farmers harvesting their olive crops in the village of Burqa, east of Ramallah, injuring two, according to Walid Assaf, head of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission.
He told WAFA that after farmers, supported by dozens of volunteers, were able to reach their lands in Burqa, which they have been denied access to for years by the Israeli occupation army, and started to harvest their olive trees settlers descended on them and attacked them.
He said the settlers, from the illegal Megron settlement, were protected by the soldiers when they attacked the farmers in an attempt to get them to leave their land and injured two of them.
Assaf said the volunteers and farmers confronted the settlers and were able to fend them off.
Rights organizations have documented a sharp rise in Israeli settlers' attacks against Palestinian farmers harvesting their olive trees or stealing their crops and of soldiers banning farmers from reaching their land in areas close to the illegal settlements or located beyond Israel's apartheid barrier.

BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, October 13, 2020 (WAFA) – A new illegal Israeli settlement outpost is in the making in the southern West Bank village of Kisan, east of Bethlehem, after settlers have fenced off dozens of dunums of Palestinian land and set up caravans on the usurped land, according to a local Palestinian official.
Hasan Breijieh, director of the Bethlehem office of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal settlement of Ebi Hanahal, built on expropriated Kisan land, have built a fence around dozens of dunums of land located southwest of the village they had taken over in September and added four caravans to the land making the total number of caravans set up on it to eight.
The settlers have also built a road to the land and prepared it in order to expand their illegal settlement, which means taking over more Palestinian land, he said.
Breijieh said fencing off the land and setting up caravans on it is a prelude to building a settlement outpost that could later expand to become a full-fledged settlement built at the expense of the local Palestinians.

They told WAFA that the force raided Qaddoura refugee camp in Ramallah early today and detained one person.
Residents clashed with the soldiers during the raid, said the sources. There were no reports of injuries.
A large Israeli force had also raided Amari refugee camp in Ramallah on Sunday in pursuit of an activist, who was not at the camp. The soldiers instead detained four members of his family in order to get him to turn himself over to them.
During the raid, heavy clashes erupted and soldiers used live fire and rubber bullets injuring at least 30 people, some of them hit by live bullets but were reported in light condition.

SALFIT, Monday, October 12, 2020 (WAFA) - Palestinians who were able to access their land located beyond Israel’s apartheid barrier in the Salfit area in the north of the occupied West Bank found out that their olive crops have been stolen and dozens of trees cut, according to residents.
Mohammad Amer, a resident of Masha village, told WAFA that two out of 20 Palestinians who own land planted with olive trees in the north of the village and located beyond the Israeli apartheid wall and were able to get access to their lands were shocked to find out that Israeli settlers from the illegal Eits Ephraim settlement have stolen their olive crops and cut branches of some 60 trees planted in a 120-dunum plot.
Israel does not allow Palestinians to reach their lands near the settlements or beyond the barrier with prior coordination and with a permit. Usually, permits are not issued except for elderly people and only on some days of the year leaving their land open for abuse by the settlers.

NABLUS, Monday, October 12, 2020 (WAFA) –Israel seems to be starting to turn some roads in the occupied West Bank into a settlers-only roads, indicating a system of apartheid being implemented in the occupied Palestinian territories and raising concern that Palestinians will not be able to use these roads to move between West Bank cities, today said Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank.
He told WAFA that Israeli settlers set up a billboard on the road linking the cities of Nablus and Qalqilya, near the illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar, which said “This road leads to Yitzhar. Entrance for Arabs is dangerous.”
He added that this came after settlers repeatedly attack Palestinians and their properties, noting that the road was closed several times to Palestinians.
Daghlas said that Israel is still working on a new bypass road for the settlers in the Huwwara area, south of Nablus, which is going to eat up hundreds of dunums of Palestinian lands, and that it has completed other settlers-only roads in the area, which is going to enforce its apartheid policy.

"Hunger striking Palestinian prisoner in Israel rejects court deal; Premier demands his release""",10/12/20 13:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120537,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, October 12, 2020 (WAFA) – Palestinian hunger striker, Maher al-Akhras, who has been on a 78-day long fast protesting his administrative detention, today rejected a deal from the Israeli High Court that recommends his release from prison in return for ending his hunger strike. At the same time, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh called for his immediate release following the serious deterioration in his health.
Shtayyeh said at the start of the weekly Palestinian cabinet meeting held in Ramallah that he holds the Israeli government fully responsible for the life of al-Akhras, urging international pressure on Israel to release him and to end its illegal administrative detention policy against Palestinian activists, who currently number 350 held in Israeli jails without charge or trial and based on secret evidence.
Al-Akhras rejected the Israeli High Court deal after only recommending his release by November 26 instead of ruling in favor of his release as requested by his lawyer in the petition submitted to the Court and was rejected today.
As a result, and according to his lawyer, al-Akhras decided to continue with his hunger strike until there is a definite and clear position from the High Court or the Israeli occupation authorities setting a specific date for his release and not only a recommendation.
According to prisoners’ advocacy groups, this is the second time in few weeks the Israeli High Court plays with words in deciding the fate of al-Akhras after calling on September 23 for “freezing” the administrative detention order, and now only “recommending” an end to it.
Al-Akhras, 49, from the northern West Bank district of Jenin, started his hunger strike immediately after his detention from his home on July 27 after which he was slammed with a four-month administrative detention order that is supposed to end on November 26 but could be renewed for an indefinite number of times.
Advocacy groups and his family say that al-Akhras is currently kept at an Israeli hospital following a serious and critical deterioration in his health, particularly after he stopped taking food supplements or undergoing physical checkups. They fear he could die at any moment.

RAMALLAH, Monday, October 12, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli settlers today attacked Palestinian farmers harvesting their olive crops in the village of Burqa, northeast of Ramallah, according to the village’s head of local council Adnan Habas.
He told WAFA that a group of settlers attacked the Palestinian farmers as they were picking their olive crops in the north of the village in an attempt to prevent them from continuing in the harvest.
He said the settlers also hurled stones at the farmers, who attempted to fend off the attack, inflicting injuries on five of them and damaging two vehicles.
This week, the West Bank witnessed a wave of Israeli settler attacks and agricultural terrorism as Palestinian farmers began the year’s olive harvest. The attacks included chopping down and setting fire to olive trees in various areas of the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli occupation army also contributed to sabotaging the Palestinian olive harvest season by preventing farmers from reaching their lands located near the settlements or beyond the apartheid barrier.
The olive harvest season, which has just started, is one of the most important for thousands of Palestinian households in the occupied territories whose income depends heavily on the success of this season.

BETHLEHEM, Monday, October 12, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities have approved the construction of hundreds of new housing units on expropriated Palestinian lands to the west of the occupied southern West Bank city of Bethlehem to expand an illegal colonial settlement, a local official said today.
Hasan Breijieh, head of the Bethlehem office of the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission, told WAFA that, based on Israeli reports, the occupation authorities have approved the construction of 500 housing units in the illegal Israeli settlement of Tzur Hadassah, which is built on lands belonging to Palestinians from Wadi Fukin village.
He said that Israel is targeting Bethlehem with plans to expand its illegal settlements built around the biblical city and district since the start of the occupation the latest of which was rezoning al-Tamara village, east of Bethlehem, in order to include more of its land to the area settlements, as well as barring landowners and villagers from accessing their lands located near the settlements.
Palestinian farmers who need to access their lands near settlements or beyond the Israeli apartheid barrier, particularly in the current olive harvest season, are required to obtain a permit from the military government, which is rarely given except for people over 70 years of age who cannot do the work alone, forcing owners to risk reaching their lands without permission.

Protesters gathered at hundreds of locations across the country due to a nationwide coronavirus lockdown that prevents them from protesting at the usual site outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. The current lockdown regulations allow people only to gather within one kilometer of their home.
The main rally was held at the central Habima Square in Tel Aviv, from which the protesters marched through the city. They waved pink and black flags symbolizing various grassroots protest movements. Some of the banners, using Netanyahu’s nickname, said, “Bibi, you are destroying my future.” Others read “Go!”
The Black Flags movement, one of the groups leading the demonstrations, said demonstrations were scheduled in 1,200 locations across the country.
This was the 16th consecutive Saturday on which demonstrations were staged against the Israeli premier. Smaller protests would also take place on other weekdays.
Netanyahu has been on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes for his role in a series of scandals. Netanyahu has denied the charges and accuses the protesters of being “leftists” and “anarchists”.

"Israeli navy attack fishermen off Gaza""",10/11/20 08:16,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120518,"
GAZA, Sunday, October 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli navy opened gunfire today towards Palestinian fishermen sailing offshore Gaza City forcing them to leave to the shore, WAFA correspondent reported.
He said Israeli navy opened heavy gunfire and water hoses at the fishermen  who were sailing about three nautical miles from the shore. The fishermen had to leave the water and abruptly end their fishing mission for fear being killed or injured. No injuries were reported though.
Israel has imposed a strict blockade on the Gaza Strip for the last 14 years, including occasionally not allowing fishing in Gaza waters, a main source of livelihood for the two million population of the beleaguered coastal enclave.
Israeli navy harassment of Palestinian fishermen off Gaza has become a daily occurrence aimed at discouraging them from proceeding with fishing, a vital source of income to thousands of Gaza families.

Murad Shtawi, director of the commission in the north of the West Bank, accused the Israeli military and settlers in an interview on Voice of Palestine radio of attempting to sabotage the olive harvest season, which Palestinians anxiously wait for every year due to its importance to their welfare.
He said in addition to the Israeli occupation measures, the settlers also contribute to this by torching olive fields or stealing the harvest under army protection.

Nafisa Khwais, 68, from the Mount of Olives neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, has been banned from entering Al-Aqsa Mosque due to her activities at the Muslim holy place against attempts by Jewish fanatics in collusion with the Israeli government to change the status quo at the Mosque.
As a result of the ban as well as current coronavirus restrictions on movement, she is forced to perform the prayers near her home and away from the walled compound where she is seen in this picture praying at a location on Mount of Olives overlooking Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Old City when Jewish fanatics started to harass her as she prayed.

BETHLEHEM, Friday, October 09, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces ordered today the demolition of an inhabited Palestinian-owned house in the village of al-Khader, to the south of Bethlehem City in the occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Hasan Burajiya, director of the Wall and Colonization Resistance Commission's office in the district, told WAFA that Samih Ahmad Salah, a local Palestinian villager, was informed by the Israeli occupation army that his home will be demolished within the upcoming 96 hours, under the pretext  that the home was built without an Israeli permit.
Salah said he had his house demolished by the Israeli occupation authorities three times in the past, and every time the house was demolished he would resume construction again in order to shelter his family.
The area where the home is slated for demolition is classified as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank where Israel retains military and civilian control. 
Palestinians living in this area are frequently exposed to the danger of home demolitions by the occupation authorities under the pretext of lacking an Israeli permit.

He said when residents rushed to their land to put off the fire, which lasted for three hours, Israeli soldiers stationed in the area prevented them from crossing the apartheid barrier that separates Palestinian villagers from their farms to reach their lands and save the trees.
Israel intervened to put off the fire and used a helicopter to do that only after it threatened the nearby illegal Jewish settlement of Orlinim, built on land seized from Safa village.
Palestinians have just started the olive harvest season in the West Bank, a main source of income for thousands of Palestinian families. However, Israeli settlers regularly attack Palestinian harvesters and burn down of cut olive trees in hate crimes committed against the civilian Palestinian population under Israeli occupation.

"Israeli settlers damage olive saplings south of Hebron""",10/8/20 13:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120488,"
HEBRON, Thursday, October 08, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today damaged dozens of olive saplings to the east of Yatta town, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, according to local sources.
Fouad al-Amur, a local activist, confirmed that a group of settlers damaged and uprooted dozens of olive saplings which were planted by Jabr Awad, a farmer, in his plot of land, located to the east of Yatta, in a clear attempt to seize it together with larger surrounding area in favor of colonial settlement expansion. 
The settlers came from the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Mitzpe Yair.
Yesterday, settlers set fire to 50 olive trees in the village of Deir Ballut, west of Salfit, and assaulted olive harvesters in Huwara town, south of Nablus.
With more than 12 million olive trees planted across 45% of the West Bank’s agricultural land, the olive harvest constitutes one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.
According to UN OCHA, the olive oil industry supports the livelihoods of more than 100,000 families and accounts for a quarter of the gross agricultural income of the occupied territories.
But, as local NGO MIFTAH notes, “olive trees carry more than an economic significance in the lives of Palestinians. They are not just like any other trees, they are symbolic of Palestinians’ attachment to their land.”
“Because the trees are drought-resistant and grow under poor soil conditions, they represent Palestinian resistance and resilience. The fact that olive trees live and bear fruit for thousands of years is parallel to Palestinian history and continuity on the land.”

"Israel bans Fatah official entry into West Bank""",10/8/20 13:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120487,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, October 08, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today banned a Fatah official entry into the occupied West Bank for three months, according to said.
The authorities banned the secretary of Fatah movement in Jerusalem Yasser Darwish from entering the West Bank for three months.
Darwish was detained by Israeli Intelligence on a main road artery and transferred to al-Maskoubiya detention and interrogation facility earlier today.
He said that he was accused of attending an anti-normalization festival organized by Fatah in the Jerusalem-district town of Anata, noting that he was released on the condition of being banned from entering the West Bank for three months and severing contact with the Palestinian leadership.
Darwish was detained several times before and was banned from his home for days.
Israeli police cracks down on any Palestinian official activity in Jerusalem as part of Israel’s aim to eradicate any manifestation of Palestinian political presence and identity, and frequently detains officials and activists from the city, which it occupied along the rest of the West Bank in June 1967.
It ‘annexed’ East Jerusalem shortly later, claiming it part of its ""indivisible capital,"" which has never been recognized by most of the international community as the Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state.
Rights groups have long pointed out that Israel’s discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem – which include routine home demolitions, discriminatory allocation of building permits, and the eviction of Palestinians from their homes for the benefit of Israeli settlers – are aimed at driving out Palestinians from the city.
With over 70 percent of Palestinian families in occupied East Jerusalem living below the poverty line, if life becomes too expensive, they have little choice but to move to congested Jerusalem neighborhoods on the other side of Israel’s apartheid wall or into the West Bank.
After Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were not given Israeli citizenship, but were instead issued permanent residency permits, which can be revoked by Israel for a variety of reasons, including  insufficient loyalty to the State of Israel.

"Suffocation injuries during Israeli raid in Nablus-district town""",10/8/20 09:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120483,"
NABLUS, Thursday, October 08, 2020 (WAFA) – A number of Palestinians dawn Thursday morning suffered from suffocation during an Israeli military raid into Sebastia town, north of Nablus city, according to local sources.
Sebastia Mayor, Mohammad Azem, told WAFA that Israeli forces barged their way into the town early morning, sparking confrontations during which they targeted protestors with barrages of tear gas canisters, causing a number to suffocate. 
During the raid, Azem added, Israeli forces ransacked a house, wreaking havoc inside it and turning it upside down.
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
Located 11 kilometers to the northwest of Nablus, Sebastia is a small historical town located on a hill with panoramic views across the West Bank and has a population of some 3,000 Palestinians.
A prominent settlement during the Iron Age as well as the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the town embraces a Roman amphitheater, temples, a Byzantine and a crusader churches, dedicated to Saint John the Forerunner, who baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River, besides to a mosque built in honor of the saint. Christians and Muslims believe the town to be the burial place of the saint.
Israel has been attempting to take over the town, which has become a site of heated cultural conflict, preventing the Palestinian Authority from conducting restoration works at the site, prohibiting providing tourist services to visitors from around the world, and stealing antiquities from it.
Palestinians complain that Israeli settlers have repeatedly attacked the town and fenced parts of its antiquities, where they hold religious rituals.
Owners of restaurants and hotels complain about the Israeli acts in the town which have caused them severe damages and losses.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Following successful legal action against East Jerusalem demolitions, rights group demands similar freeze in West Bank""",10/7/20 16:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120479,"
HAIFA, Wednesday, October 07, 2020 (WAFA) – Following a successful legal action demanding a halt on Israeli demolition of Palestinian homes in occupied East Jerusalem during the COVID-19 crisis, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel sent another urgent letter on 5 October to the commander of the Israeli military’s Civil Administration demanding he immediately halts the demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank as residents contend with another spike in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the period from March to September 2020 saw the demolition or confiscation of 370 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank. This marked the highest average monthly demolition rate in four years.
Adalah Attorney Suhad Bishara noted in the urgent letter that Israeli demolitions during this period left 305 people homeless.
Jamie McGoldrick, deputy special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, also warned that “the demolition of essential structures during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly worrying as it further compounds the overall situation in the West Bank.”
In addition to homes, Israeli demolitions also targeted Palestinian properties including water, hygiene and sanitation assets, and structures used for agriculture, undermining the access of many to livelihoods and services. Moreover, 50 of the structures had been given to Palestinians as humanitarian aid, and their destruction hit the most vulnerable of all, undermining essential emergency operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the additional restrictions placed on Palestinian residents of the West Bank also makes it significantly more difficult – both practically and economically – for those whose homes have been demolished to secure legal defense.
Attorney Suhad Bishara, director of Adalah’s Land and Planning Rights Unit, wrote in the urgent letter: “In the current global reality brimming with fear and near-constant uncertainty, it is most unfortunate that Israel finds it appropriate to add to people's pain and suffering by illegally demolishing their homes, livelihoods, and essential infrastructures. Israel’s demolitions amplify the vulnerability of Palestinians seeking to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic while under occupation. We demand Israel immediately halt its demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank.”
Earlier, and following Adalah’s legal action against East Jerusalem home demolitions, Israel agreed on 1 October to freeze demolitions nationwide.
According to a report by OCHA, Israel demolished 31 buildings in East Jerusalem in July and August, leaving about 96 people homeless.
As of August, and since the beginning of 2020, Israel has demolished 112 Palestinian buildings and 261 people were left homeless as a result, including countless children. An additional 467 Palestinian residents were harmed as a result of partial demolitions of structures by Israeli authorities.

SALFIT, Wednesday, October 7, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today torched an olive grove belonging to Deir Ballut town, west of Salfit, according to a local municipal source.
The town mayor Yahya Mustafa told WAFA that a group of settlers set fire to 50 olive trees, located to the east of the town, and identified the landlords as Yousef, Mustafa and Sbeih Abdul-Ilah.
Located 15 kilometers to the west of Salfit city, Deir Ballut has a population of some 4,100 and occupied a total area of 11,900 dunams. It boasts several archeological sites dating back to the Byzantine era, such as St. Simeon Monastery and al-Qal‘a Monastery. 
Before 1948, the village owned 40,000 dunums of land (10,000 acres). In 1967, 20% of the land of DeirBallut (or 2,000 acres) was confiscated into Israel. Since then, like so many other villages in Palestine, Deir Ballut has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a small pocket of land occupying 621 dunams, accounting for almost 5 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, which encircles the village from three directions, confiscating and isolating some 4,050 dunams of fertile land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
Israel has established two colonial settlements, namely Alei Zahav and Pedu’el, on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated more land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road 446, which extends two kilometers on the village’s land.

"Settlers attack olive harvesters south of Nablus, injure three""",10/7/20 14:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120474,"
NABLUS, Wednesday, October 07, 2020 (WAFA) – Three Palestinians were today injured after Israeli settlers assaulted olive harvesters in the groves of Huwara town, south of Nablus, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a number of settlers attacked Palestinian farmers as they were picking their olive trees, inflicting injuries and bruises on three of them.
He added that this was the third settler attack against Palestinian olive harvesters in the last 24 hours in Nablus.
The settlers came from Yitzhar, a colonial settlement notorious for its hardcore religious community.
With more than 12 million olive trees planted across 45% of the West Bank’s agricultural land, the olive harvest constitutes one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.
According to UN OCHA, the olive oil industry supports the livelihoods of more than 100,000 families and accounts for a quarter of the gross agricultural income of the occupied territories.
But, as local NGO MIFTAH notes, “olive trees carry more than an economic significance in the lives of Palestinians. They are not just like any other trees, they are symbolic of Palestinians’ attachment to their land.”
“Because the trees are drought-resistant and grow under poor soil conditions, they represent Palestinian resistance and resilience. The fact that olive trees live and bear fruit for thousands of years is parallel to Palestinian history and continuity on the land.”

HEBRON, Tuesday, October 06, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today assaulted Palestinian shepherds to the east of Yatta town, in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Member of local popular committees, Rateb al-Jbour, said a group of settlers, under military protection, attacked Palestinian shepherds while herding their sheep in the open pastures claiming the area was a “state land”.
The settlers entered into a scuffle with the herders, who attempted to defend their right to access the pastures. No injuries were reported though.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property, which includes arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others, is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
There are more than 800,000 Israeli settlers living in illegal colonial settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

HEBRON, Tuesday, October 06, 2020 (WAFA) – An Israeli settler set up a tent on Palestinian-owned land in Birin village, located to the east of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to a local activist.
Member of the Popular Committees in Southern Hebron, Rateb al-Jbour, said that a settler set up a tent on a plot of land belonging the Burqan family from Birin, east of Yatta, and hoisted the Israeli flag in the vicinity as a prelude to seizing the land for the construction of a new colonial settlement.
Located to the southwest of Bani Na‘im, Birin has a population of 160 and is flanked by Bani Haiver colonial settlement from the east and the settler-only bypass Road No. 60 from the west. Its residents were originally expelled from Naqab desert in the south of the country following Israel’s creation in 1948 and now depend on agriculture and livestock as their main source of livelihood.
Yet, Israel is trying to end Palestinian presence in Birin and in the south of the West Bank in its effort to take over the Palestinian land for its settlement schemes.

"Palestinian killed by Israeli military gunfire east of Tulkarem""",10/5/20 22:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120458,"
TULKAREM, Monday, October 5, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Monday night shot and killed a Palestinian youth at Ennab checkpoint, east of Tulkarm city.
Witnesses confirmed that they saw the young man lying on the ground bleeding to death after sustaining critical wounds from Israeli military gunfire near the checkpoint.
They added that Israeli forces closed the checkpoint in both directions, causing serious traffic jam.
The fatality was confirmed as a resident of Beit Lid town, also written as Bayt Lid, southwest of Tulkarm.
Soldiers also set up a checkpoint at the entrance of the town, holding scores of vehicles travelling along the nearby main road, as large number of infantry troops were deployed in the farmlands surrounding the town.
Meanwhile, Israeli media sources claimed that the man was killed purportedly for hurling Molotov cocktails at Israeli force, near the nearby colonial settlement of Einav.
The circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Though Israeli military has claimed that Palestinians were allegedly attempting to carry out attacks, in a majority of instances when Palestinians were killed human rights groups have disputed Israel’s version of events, arguing that many alleged attackers could have been subdued in a non-lethal manner.

"Despite 71 days of hunger strike, Israel insists on keeping Palestinian administrative detainee behind bars""",10/5/20 14:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120454,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, October 05, 2020 (WAFA) – After 71 days of hunger strike and a serious deterioration in his health, Palestinian administrative detainee Maher Akhras, 49, remains behind bars after the Israel Prison Service (IPS) has refused to set him free, today said the Palestinian Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Commission.
Commission spokesman Hasan Abed Rabbo told WAFA that Akhras, a father of six children from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, is going through a very difficult time with the loss of 20 kilograms of his weight and is developing other impediments along with occasional loss of consciousness as a result of 71 days of fast demanding an end to his administrative detention without charge or trial and his release.
He said that the IPS refused to release Akhras despite an Israeli High Court ruling, which only agreed to freeze the administrative detention order against Akhras but not cancel it or secure his release, which was rejected by the detainee.
Akhras was detained several times for his resistance of the occupation, the first time was in 1989 and then again in 2004, and in 2009 when he was kept in administrative detention for 16 months.
He was detained again in 2018, placed in prison for 11 months before he was released and then re-detained in July when he started his open-ended hunger strike against his continuous administrative detention.

RAMALLAH, Monday, October 05, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation forces today detained at least nine Palestinians in the occupied territories, including one following an alleged stabbing attempt in the south of the West Bank, according to Israeli reports and the Palestinian Prisoner Society (PPS).
Israeli reports said soldiers detained a Palestinian resident of Hebron claiming he had attempted to stab soldiers at a checkpoint near the village of Beit Ainoon. There was no Palestinian confirmation of this incident other than the detention of the Palestinian man and there were no reports of injuries among the soldiers.
The PPS also said the army detained two Palestinian residents of the village of Beit Fajjar, in the south of the West Bank, and four others from the north of the West Bank, three of them from the city of Jenin and one from Nablus.
In occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli forces detained two Palestinian residents of Issawiyeh neighborhood.
(In a later update on the detentions, the PPS included three other Palestinians detained by the Israeli occupation forces in the south of the West Bank. They included a 56-year-old man and his 33-year-old son, raising the total detained today for resisting the occupation to 12.)

TEL AVIV, Sunday, October 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of Israelis demonstrating against embattled Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu were arrested last during clashes with the police in Tel Aviv and in other locations where anti-Netanyahu protests resumed yesterday across the country.
Israeli police also issued hundreds of tickets to protesters under the pretext of violating the coronavirus lockdown rules which prohibit gatherings of more than 20 persons.   
Meanwhile, Israeli media said tens of thousands of protesters gathered at their nearest bridges and junctions to demand Netanyahu to step down. Last month, the Knesset passed a bill stating that, due to the coronavirus crisis and the lockdown, protesters may only demonstrate within a one-kilometer distance from their homes.
The protests in Tel Aviv saw clashes between protesters and police, and many protesters were fined for not wearing masks and being farther from their homes than the legal limit.  
Protesters in many areas of the country also reported that they had been verbally assaulted by passersby, including those that drove by them. Demonstrators in Rishon Lezion told reporters that a vehicle repeatedly drove past them with someone inside comparing them to “Nazi Germany.”
Israelis have been demonstrating for several months demanding Netanyahu to resign over corruption charges and mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak.
Last year Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. Many protesters say he should not serve as a prime minister at a time when he is on trial for serious charges.

"Israeli military infiltrate Gaza border, raze farmland""",10/1/20 10:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120402,"
KHAN YOUNIS, Thursday, October 1, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military vehicles early on Thursday infiltrated Gaza’s border to the east of Khan Younis city, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers advanced several dozens of meters to the east of Khazaa'a town, east of the city, and proceeded to raze farmlands near the borderline.
He added that Israeli forces shot fire as they carried out the land razing, forcing farmers and shepherds to flee the scene in fear for their lives.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, September 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation police today detained a Palestinian woman resident of occupied East Jerusalem, who was previously detained and banned from entering the Muslim holy compound, Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's old city.
Witnesses said police raided the home of Aida Sidawi in Jerusalem's old city and detained her. She was taken to the police station at Jaffa Gate.
""The intelligence forces have raided my home and took me to the Qishla,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. The Qishla is the police station at Jaffa Gate, one of the gates to the old city of Jerusalem.
Sidawi was detained several times in the past for her resistance of Israeli interference in the affairs of Al-Aqsa Mosque and for allowing fanatic Jews free access to the Muslim holy compound. She has been banned by police from entering the walled holy compound for several weeks and months in a row.

"Israeli bulldozers uproot olive trees west of Bethlehem""",9/30/20 14:40,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120390,"
BETHLEHEM, Wednesday, September 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today uprooted scores of perennial olive trees from farmlands belonging to Husan village, west of Bethlehem city, according to a municipal source.
Head of Husan Village Council, Mohammad Sabatin, confirmed that Israeli forces uprooted scores of olive trees from Khirbet Hammuda, an olive grove located to the west of the village, leveled the three-donum grove, and tore down a shack and retaining walls.
The grove owner was identified as Adel Shusha.
The grove was leveled purportedly for being located “under Israeli sovereignty”, where Palestinian farmers are banned access.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

"Israeli forces demolish structures in southern Hebron hills """,9/30/20 11:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120388,"
HEBRON, Wednesday, September 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday demolished a number of Palestinian-owned structures Khirbet Shaab al-Butum, to the east Yatta town, south of Hebron city, according to local sources.
Coordinator of the Popular Committees in Southern Hebron, Rateb al-Jabour, told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers into the community, where the heavy machinery tore down a room, a residential tent and a shack belonging to Musa al-Jabareen.
The bulldozers also demolished two other rooms, made of brick and tin sheets, a fodder shack and a traditional oven, known in Arabic as Tabun, belonging to Mohammad al-Jabareen.
He noted that the structures were demolished purportedly for their proximity to the nearby Israeli colonial settlement of Avigail.
Khirbet Shaab al-Butum is among dozens of small communities located in the Masafer Yatta area, which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood, and has a population of 300.
Masafer Yatta is classified as Area C, which is under full Israeli military control. Area C makes up around 60 percent of the area of the occupied West Bank, which Israel plans to annex after expelling its Palestinian population.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.

"Israeli forces demolish structure in the Jordan Valley""",9/30/20 11:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120387,"
JERICHO, Wednesday, September 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday demolished a structure in the village of al-Jiftlik, located to the north of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, local sources confirmed.
Aref Daraghmeh, a human rights activist, told WAFA that the forces demolished a tin-sheet two-room structure belonging to Hassan Kaa‘abneh in the village.
Israeli forces have recently escalated the demolitions and served demolition orders against Palestinian-owned homes and structures in the village.
Horizontally located 33 kilometers to the north of Jericho, al-Jiftlik has a population of some 5,500, who predominantly depend on agriculture and livestock for their main source of livelihood. The village occupies a total area of 185,032 dunums.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, Israel maintains full control over the village, classified as Area C, and has allowed the villagers to build within a small pocket of 972 dunams, which accounts for 0.5 percent of the total village area.
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to water in the area, particularly the 23 underground wells used for agriculture. Local water springs are susceptible to dryness and depletion as a result of Israel’s control over water.
The Israeli water company of Mekorot has depleted the wells and has been granted monopoly on the excavation, restoration, distribution and selling of water. In contrast, Palestinians have been forbidden from constructing new wells and restoring existing ones.
Israel has seized at least some 6,750 dunams belonging to the village for the construction of seven nearby colonial settlements, 4,550 dunums for the construction of a military base, besides to more land for opening settler-only by-pass Roads No. 90, 50, 505 and 508, and constructing colonial outposts, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

NABLUS, Tuesday, September 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a shack at the entrance of Beita town, south of Nablus city, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement construction in the northern West Bank, confirmed that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to the entrance of the town, where the heavy machinery demolished a 500-metersqaure shack belonging to Jamal Khader.
Meanwhile, witnesses confirmed that an Israeli military bulldozer demolished a gas station and a vegetables display stand to the south of Qalanidia military checkpoint, north of Jerusalem.
Owners of the demolished structures were identified as residents of Qalandia refugee camp.

"Israel tightens restrictions, seizes house backyard in Hebron""",9/29/20 13:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120378,"
HEBRON, Tuesday, September 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today tightened their restrictions and seized the backyard of a house in Tal Rumedia neighborhood in the central part of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, according to WAFA correspondent.
She said that Israeli forces erected a number of poles as a prelude to the installation of more surveillance cameras in the Hebron neighborhood of Tal Rumeida.
Meanwhile, Imad Abu Shamsiyya, an activist working with the Youths against Settlements (YAS), an organization that documents human rights abuses carried out by the Israeli military in Hebron, said that the poles were erected to install more surveillance cameras in the Palestinian neighborhood purportedly to secure the Ramat Yishai colonial settlement.
He added that Israeli forces seized the backyard of Hasan Abu Aisha’s house to erect one of the poles and warned that such surveillance cameras monitor the movement of the residents of the Palestinian neighborhood, even while they are inside their house, violating their privacy.
The city of Hebron, which houses the Ibrahimi Mosque, is home to roughly 160,000 Palestinian Muslims and about 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers who live in compounds heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
Israel has expelled the only international monitors protecting Hebron’s Palestinians from 800 heavily guarded settlers, one of whom committed the 1994 massacre that triggered their deployment.
Such Israeli measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

"Israeli forces demolish structures near Tubas, seize broadcasting van""",9/29/20 11:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120377,"
TUBAS, Tuesday, September 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Tuesday morning demolished two residential structures in Khirbet Yarza village, east of the northern West Bank city of Tubas, under the pretext of unlicensed building, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that a large unit of Israeli forces, escorting military bulldozers, raided the village, where they cordoned off the area as the heavy machineries tore down two residential rooms belonging to Rami and Hafeth Masa‘id, displacing the occupants. 
The soldiers, he added, prevented journalists on the scene from covering the demolition, and seized a Palestine TV broadcasting van. 
He noted that the Israeli occupation authorities handed the Masa‘id brothers demolition orders a week ago, and this demolition was a part of the ongoing large-scale demolitions of residential and agricultural structures in this village, which all aim to force residents out of it and seize their land for colonial settlement construction.
Khirbet Yarza is a marginalized hamlet, and most of its lands are planted with Israeli landmines. 
The residents of Yarza, located in the area designated as C, which is under full Israeli military rule, make a living off shepherding and live in natural caves, in shacks, or in tents. Over the years, the Civil Administration has repeatedly demolished the community’s structures.
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israel denies Palestinians’ access to Ibrahimi Mosque for Jewish holidays""",9/28/20 12:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120366,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, September 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Monday denied Palestinian worshippers access to the Ibrahimi Mosque in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, citing the Jewish holidays as a pretext, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that large number of Israeli soldiers deployed in the vicinity of the mosque and around the old city, placing stifling restrictions on Palestinian movement and life, as illegal fanatic settlers were preparing to celebrate Yom Kippur.
Director of the mosque Hifthi Abu Sneineh told WAFA that the closure went into effect on Sunday afternoon and it would remain imposed until 10:00 P.M. on Monday, noting that the settlers set up tents in the area.
Member of the PLO Executive Committee Ahmad Tamimi slammed the closure as a “blatant infringement” upon Palestinians and Muslims’ human rights, including the right to freedom of worship.  
A week ago, Israeli authorities closed the mosque for two days in a row in order to make way for Jewish settlers to celebrate Rosh Hashanah holiday, or the Jewish New Year.
Twenty six years ago, Israeli settler Baruch Goldstein broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and opened fire at Palestinian Muslim worshippers, killing 29. Four Palestinians were killed on the same day in the clashes that broke out around the Mosque in response to the massacre.
In the aftermath, the mosque, known to Jews as Tomb of the Patriarchs, was divided in two, with the larger part turned into a synagogue while heavy scrutiny was imposed on the Palestinians and areas closed completely to them, including an important market and the main street, Shuhada street.
An estimated 800 notoriously aggressive Israeli settlers live under the protection of thousands of soldiers in Hebron’s city center. The city is home to over 30,000 Palestinians.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.

TEL AVIV, Sunday, September 27, 2020 (WAFA) – A new report by Israeli daily Maariv has revealed that former Israeli Minister of “Defense” Moshe Dayan had stolen and smuggled antiques from Sinai during the Israeli occupation of the peninsula following the 1967 war.
Maariv’s journalist Ido Dissentshik revealed that his father, Arie, who was an editor at Marriv, had caught Dayan stealing antiques from Sinai while the former was serving in the Israeli reserve forces.
Dissentshik added that Dayan also supervised diggings that aimed at finding antiques before he could steal and smuggle them back to his house in Israel.
According to Dissentshik, Dayan would carry out diggings in Serabit el-Khadim, a locality in the southwest of Sinai, before he could smuggle the antiques in bags that were being carried in a helicopter.
The Israeli newspaper added that Dayan continued to smuggle Egyptian-owned antiques during the period from 1967 and until the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai in 1973.

"Israelis resume anti-Netanyahu protests despite COVID-19 lockdown""",9/27/20 10:29,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120356,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, September 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israelis resumed protests in occupied Jerusalem last night demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, despite a tightened lockdown imposed by the Israeli government in an effort to keep the coronavirus pandemic under control.
According to Israeli media, protesters also gathered in Tel Aviv and the seafront city of Caesarea, and organizers were quoted as saying that around 16,000 joined the demonstrations in person.
Many of the demonstrators hoisted Israeli flags, with some of them waving banners accusing Netanyahu of “White House laundromat,” in reference to a Washington Post report last week that the Israeli premier has brought bags of dirty laundry with him to be cleaned during his visits to the White House. 
For over three months, thousands of Israelis have took the streets of central Jerusalem near Netanyahu’s residence, calling on him to step down. Protesters say Netanyahu should not remain in office when he is on trial for corruption charges and accuse mishandling the coronavirus crisis.  
Last year Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. Many protesters say he should not serve as a prime minister at a time when he is on trial for serious charges.
On Friday, Israeli authorities tightened the coronavirus restrictions, including limiting international travel and attending indoor prayers.

"Two Palestinians injured as Jewish settlers attack poultry farms in north of West Bank""",9/26/20 14:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120347,"
NABLUS, Saturday, September 26, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinians were today injured by Israeli occupation forces during clashes that erupted in the village of Qusra, to the south of northern West Bank city of Nablus, following an attack by Jewish settlers on two Palestinian-owned poultry farms in the village, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers attacked the poultry farms, located on the outskirts of Qusra, ransacked them and destroyed their content.
The settlers also set fire to a tractor that was parked in one of the farms and damaged water tanks.
Daghlas said that as residents rushed to protect their property, Israeli soldiers, who were in the area, intervened only to protect the settlers and attacked the Palestinians.
In the clashes that ensued, the Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds at the village residents injuring two of them.
Israeli settler violence is commonplace across the occupied West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by the occupation authorities, leaving Palestinians vulnerable to their attacks.

"UN: Israel demolished or seized 22 Palestinian structures in two weeks displacing 50 people and affecting 200 others""",9/26/20 11:25,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120343,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, 26 September 2020 (WAFA) - Twenty-two Palestinian-owned structures were demolished or seized by the Israeli occupation authorities during the period between 8 and 21 September for the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, displacing 50 Palestinians, and otherwise affecting about 200 people, according to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) occupied Palestinian territory.
Twelve of the demolitions, including eight carried out by the owners of the structures, were recorded in East Jerusalem. These have generated all displacements recorded in this period, said the biweekly report. So far this year, slightly over half of all demolitions in East Jerusalem (134) were carried out by the owners, following the issuance of demolition orders, to avoid higher fines and fees.
The other 10 structures were in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military rule. Five of these were demolished in al-Taybe, in the Hebron district in the south of the West Bank, and Beit Sira, in the Ramallah area, on the basis of the Military Order 1797, which allows demolitions within 96 hours of the issuance of a ‘removal order’. 
On 10 September, the Humanitarian Coordinator raised concerns over the sharp increase in demolitions since the outbreak of the pandemic, and called upon the Israeli authorities to immediately halt this unlawful practise.
Also during the reporting period, OCHA said some 550 Palestinian-owned trees were uprooted or otherwise vandalized, reportedly by Israeli settlers, in three incidents. The largest incident took place on land cultivated by three families from Biddya village in the Salfit district in the north of the West Bank, where settlers bulldozed and destroyed 445 fruit trees, an agricultural structure and 1.7-km-long stone walls and iron fences in order establish a new illegal settlement there.
The other two incidents occurred in Areas B, under partial Palestinian rule, and C, near al- Sawiya village in the Nablus district in the north of the West Bank, where some 100 olive trees were cut down or otherwise vandalized.
Since the beginning of the year, nearly 5,000 Palestinian-owned trees, mostly olives, have been destroyed or damaged. The annual olive harvest season will officially start on 7 October, amid serious access restrictions to land near settlements and behind the separation barrier, said OCHA.

"After holding it for one year, Israel turns over body of a Palestinian mother of nine to her family for proper burial""",9/26/20 09:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120341,"
RAMALLAH, Saturday, September 26, 2020 (WAFA) – More than a year after shooting and killing her and holding her body, the Israeli occupation authorities yesterday turned over the corpse of Naifa Kaabna, 50, a Palestinian mother of nine from Aqbat Jabr refugee camp in the eastern West Bank city of Jericho, to her family for proper burial, according to the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC).
Israeli occupation forces shot and killed Kaabna in what Palestinians have charged was in cold blood at Qalandia military checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem alleging she attempted to stab a soldier.
JLAC attempted since the shooting to get Israel to return the body to her family for burial and to investigate the incident, as well as turn over video recordings at the checkpoint to the center without any avail, it said, and the body was kept in the morgue all this time.
The human right center petitioned the Israeli High Court in February to get the body of Kaabna back, but the court has delayed any action until in August it ordered the army to explain why it was still holding Kaabna’s body.
The army decided yesterday to turn the body over to her family and Kaabna was finally laid to rest at her refugee camp.
Israel decided on October 13, 2015 to withhold bodies of Palestinians its forces kill in the occupied territories and use them as a bargaining chip in future prisoners’ exchange talks with the Palestinian factions.
According to JLAC, Israel is holding bodies of 66 Palestinians its forces have shot and killed in the last years, most of them kept in the morgues, while some were buried in unknown locations. In addition, 254 Palestinians killed by Israel since 1967 are still buried in what is known as “numbered cemeteries” in Israel, while 74 are still unaccounted for.

"Urgent appeal: Lab equipment for coronavirus testing urgently needed""",9/25/20 12:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120332,"
GAZA, Friday, September 25, 2020 (WAFA) - The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that the operational materials needed to run one of Gaza’s COVID-19 testing devices have run out. As a result, Gaza’s central laboratory is currently operating at half capacity, which drastically undermines the MOH’s efforts to contain and track COVID-19. Laboratory material and testing kits are urgently needed in order for the MOH to test potential COVID-19 cases and to take random swabs from within the general population. The MOH further warned that the laboratory might stop working completely within few days if the shortage in materials persisted.
Some two million Palestinians in the impoverished Gaza Strip are currently struggling to combat a potentially devastating outbreak of COVID-19 with minimal resources and a healthcare system that is on the brink of collapse after almost 14 years of Israel’s illegal closure restrictions and repeat military attacks.
Gaza lacks proper hygiene and sanitation, the natural sources of drinking water are largely contaminated, fuel and electricity supplies are insufficient, pollution is rampant, infrastructure is crumbling, and overcrowded living conditions in one of the most densely populated areas in the world make social distancing impossible to maintain. These poor health and hygiene conditions have been exacerbated by the lockdown imposed by the local authorities in August. Breadwinners and daily-wage laborers have been confined to their houses, which means that the financial stability of more than half of Gaza’s population is undermined, leading to a potential surge in food insecurity, which already stands at 70 percent.
Alarmed by the looming humanitarian catastrophe facing the population in Gaza, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights calls on the international community and concerned agencies, NGOs and international bodies to urgently mobilize support for residents of the Gaza Strip, and crucially, to ramp up supplies of medical equipment and testing kits necessary to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

Soldiers also detained a Palestinian after raiding and ransacking his family house in Jalazone refugee camp, north of Ramallah.
In Hebron district in the south of the West Bank, PPS said the Israeli military raided Beit Ummar town, north of Hebron, and detained a former prisoner.
Meanwhile, a journalist was detained at al-Karameh border crossing with Jordan while he was on his way back to his Qalqilya hometown.

"Israel seals off road in Nablus-district village""",9/24/20 12:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120320,"
NABLUS, Thursday, September 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today sealed off a road in Asira al-Qibliya village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said the Israeli forces re-closed the road, which was recently rehabilitated and paved by the town council, using concrete blocks, purportedly for being located in Area C.
He noted that the road was closed for the first time in August under the same pretext before the villagers reopened it.
The closure of the road would make it difficult for the village farmers to reach their olive groves, especially during the upcoming olive harvest season.
Israel has established Yitzhar colonial settlement, notorious for its hardcore fanatic Jewish settlers, partly on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of Huwara checkpoint, which entrenches the separation of Nablus city from the cluster of southern villages and hinders Palestinians’ freedom of movement.

Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, said settler bulldozers were seen this morning leveling large tracts of land that belong to Jalud villagers to expand the nearby illegal Israeli colonial settlement of Shvut Rachel.
He added that the land leveling was carried out a day after Israeli forces and settlers prevented the villagers from reclaiming their land and constructing an agricultural road.

"Israeli occupation authorities tear down Palestinian residential structures, sheds east of Bethlehem""",9/24/20 10:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120318,"
BETHLEHEM, Thursday, September 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Bulldozers of the Israeli occupation authorities today tore down residential tents and livestock sheds in Kisan village, east of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to a local municipal source.
Head of Kisan village council, Ahmad Ghazal, said that Israeli occupation forces cordoned off an area of the village before starting to tear down three residential tents and five livestock barns purportedly for being set up without permission.
Ghazal pointed out that there has been a recent upsurge in Israeli colonial settlement encroachments upon the village, notably the seizure of large tracts of land to make room for settlement construction, the halt on the construction of a local school besides to the ongoing demolition of structures.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunums before most of the land was expropriated by Israel since the occupation of the West Bank in 1967.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides the settlement outpost of Ibei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass roads.
Israel has also constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunums of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements, and military installations.

JERICHO/RAMALLAH, Thursday, September 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Three Palestinian youths were last night shot and injured by Israeli soldiers in two separate incidents in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.
One youth was shot in the abdomen and injured late last night in the ancient city of Jericho, east of the West Bank.
Local sources said youths clashed with Israeli soldiers near Ain al-Sultan refugee camp at a location where the Israeli occupation authorities have turned a Palestinian-owned house into a Jewish synagogue.
The soldiers opened live fire at the youths, injuring one in the abdomen.
In another incident, Israeli occupation soldiers last night opened fire and injured two youths near the village of Kufr Malik, east of Ramallah.
The two were arrested and taken by the army to a hospital inside Israel where they were unconfirmed reports said they were in moderate condition.

SALFIT, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today chopped a number of olive trees in the northern West Bank town of Bidya, according to a Palestinian official.
Walid Assaf, head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, told WAFA that settlers, protected by soldiers, broke into an area of the town known as Khillet Hassan and chopped dozens of olive trees.
He said residents rushed to the scene to protect their trees and lands against the intruders.
Khillet Hassan and nearby areas have been constant targets of Israeli army and settlers incursions and destruction of property and trees as part of Israeli efforts to empty the land of its Palestinian owners for the purpose of expanding illegal settlements.
Last week, the Israeli army destroyed 200 trees in the same area and a month earlier destroyed another 200 trees in a nearby area as bulldozers worked on leveling the land.

HEBRON, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a house under construction and two water wells and removed 15 electric poles from Beit Awwa town, southwest of Hebron city, according to a local municipal source.
Mayor of Beit Awwa Abdulkarim Masalma told WAFA that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers into the town, where the heavy machineries tore down a house under construction belonging for Mufid Abu Za‘nona purportedly for being unlicensed.
Soldiers also destroyed two rainwater collection wells and removed 15 recently-installed electric poles in the area.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

GAZA, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today infiltrated Gaza’s frontier to the east of al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central besieged enclave, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that a number of Israeli military vehicles infiltrated for several dozens of meters to the east of the camp, as they opened fire and razed the borderline farmlands.
Local witnesses said that farmers tending to their farmlands had to flee the scene in fear of getting hurt amidst all the shooting and razing operations.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israeli forces demolish agricultural wall in Ramallah-district town""",9/23/20 13:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120303,"
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning demolished an agricultural wall in Ni‘lin town, west of Ramallah city, according to sources.
Mayor of Ni‘lin Emad al-Khawaja told WAFA that a unit of Israeli forces raided the town and tore down a wall surrounding a one-donum plot of agricultural land belonging to Hussein al-Khawaja in the early morning hours.
The landowner explained the Israeli authorities ordered him a month ago to halt the construction of the wall purportedly for being close to the section of Israel’s apartheid wall, built on land seized from the town, without allowing him sufficient time to appeal the decision in Israeli courts.
Located 18 kilometers to the northwest of Ramallah city, Ni‘lin has a population of some 5,900 and occupies a total area of 15,228 dunams. Since the start of the Israeli occupation in June 1967, like so many other villages in Palestine, Ni‘lin has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli colonial settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the villagers were allowed to build in only 750 dunams, accounting for 5 percent of their land.
The Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying 1,123 dunams, including the built-up area, accounting for almost 7 percent of the village’s total area. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 5,600 dunams of fertile land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Hashmona'im, Mattityahu and Modi'in Illit on 2,340 dunams of lands confiscated from the village. 
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

"Israel to demolish building, two houses southeast of Jerusalem""",9/23/20 12:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120302,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian homeowners today confirmed that they were notified about the planned demolition of their structures in Wadi al-Hummus area on the edge of Sur Baher neighborhood, southeast of Jerusalem.
Haytham Zeitoun told WAFA that he received an Israeli order several days ago, informing him that Israeli forces plan to demolish his three-floor residential building, which he built at a cost of ILS 800,000 (some USD $230,000).
He pointed out that Israel deliberately concealed its intention to demolish his building until the construction was complete although he has already obtained a building license from the Palestinian authorities as the construction area is classified as Area A, which falls under the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) full control under the Oslo Accords.
He warned that Israel harbors intentions to carry out large-scale demolitions in the area under the pretext the construction poses a threat to the Israeli security.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Amireh said that he received a similar demolition order against the second floor of his house two days ago. 
He affirmed that Israel is carrying out home demolitions as part of its ethnic cleansing policy of the Palestinians in Jerusalem in general and Wadi al-Hummus area in particular, disregarding the fact that it coasted the Palestinian homeowners a lot to build their houses after obtaining the necessary permits from the PA.
This came as a third Palestinian from the same area, identified as Ayman al-Hih, was notified about the planned demolition of his one-floor 158-square-meter house, inhabited by his family, citing the same pretext.
In July 2019, Israel demolished 10 Palestinian buildings, comprising 100 apartments, in the same area.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israeli forces demolish wedding hall near Tulkarm""",9/23/20 09:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120300,"
TULKARM, Wednesday, September 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Wednesday morning demolished a wedding hall located at the entrance of Jubara village, south of Tulkarm city, according to local sources.
Ihsan Awad, head of the Jubara Village Council, told WAFA that to their shock, a large unit of Israeli forces, escorting three bulldozers, raided the area, and cordoned off the hall, before the heavy machineries tore it down, reducing it to rubble. 
Awad added that the 900-meter-square building consisted of a small residential apartment, inhabited by a family, who were forced out before the demolition happened. He noted that the demolished building belongs to a Palestinian citizen of Israel, who previously received demolition notices under the pretext of unlicensed building, to make room for the construction of a new colonial settlement industrial zone.
Almost a month ago, Israeli forces clamped down on peaceful protestors marching against Israel’s move to level a large swath of their land for the construction of a settler-only bypass road between Jubara and Shufa villages, causing several protestors to suffocate from teargas inhalation.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israeli occupation forces detain 18 Palestinians from West Bank""",9/22/20 10:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120286,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, September 22, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today detained 18 Palestinians from various parts of the West Bank, the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said.
It said in a statement that Israeli forces rounded up six Palestinians, including two former prisoners, in multiple raids across Ramallah and al-Bireh district.
One of the six detainees was identified as a former prisoner from Jalazone refugee camp, another as a resident of Nilin village, west of Ramallah, another as a resident of Beit Rima village, northwest of Ramallah, and two others, including a former prisoner, as residents of Silwad town, east of Ramallah.
In the northern West Bank, PPS said Israeli occupation forces raided Jenin refugee camp where they rounded up four Palestinians.
Local sources added that the raid triggered violent confrontations, during which Israeli soldiers opened fire on local protestors, hitting one with a live round in the foot and causing dozens others to suffocate from teargas inhalation.
Elsewhere in the northern West Bank, PPS said that Israeli forces rounded up two Palestinians from Nablus district and two others from Tubas district.
In Bethlehem district in the south of the West Bank, PPS said an Israeli army raid into Aida refugee camp, north of the city, resulted in the detention of a Palestinian.
It added that Israeli forces carried out two separate raids in Hindaza and Marah Rabah villages, east and south of the city, resulting in the detention of two others.
A former prisoner was rearrested from Hebron district.

"FinCEN Files: Chelsea owner Abramovich helped fund Israeli settlement""",9/22/20 10:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120285,"
LONDON, Tuesday, September 22, 2020 (WAFA) - An investigation by BBC News Arabic has found that Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club, Roman Abramovich, controls companies that have donated $100 million to Elad, a settler organization operating in occupied East Jerusalem.
Elad calls Silwan, an East Jerusalem Palestinian neighborhood, “Ir David,” the “City of David” in Hebrew.
Elad also runs the City of David archaeological sites, which are a massive tourist attraction in the area, visited by over a million people a year. Elad’s former Marketing Director, Shahar Shilo, told the BBC that Elad’s strategy is using tourism “to create a different political reality in the City of David.” 
Elad relies on donors to fund its work. Nearly half of the donations it received between 2005-2018 came from four British Virgin Island companies. The person behind these companies had remained anonymous, until now.
The names of the four donating BVI-companies also appear in a set of bank documents known as the “Fincen Files.”
In the documents, banks report information about financial transactions and ownership of companies. Those documents were leaked to Buzzfeed News who shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the BBC.
In the documents, the name Roman Abramovich appears. He is named as the ultimate beneficial owner of three companies that have made donations to Elad, and he controls a fourth. Elad’s accounts show those companies have donated more than $100 million to Elad in today’s conversion rate.
That means the Chelsea football club owner has been the biggest single donor to Elad over the last 15 years.
Archaeological digs on occupied territory are governed by much debated laws, and Israel could be breaking international law by allowing Elad to carry out exploratory work in Silwan. In addition, by allowing settlement activity in the area Israel is considered to be in breach of international law.
A spokesman for Abramovich has told the BBC, “Mr Abramovich is a committed and generous supporter of Israeli and Jewish civil society, and over the past 20 years he has donated over five hundred million dollars to support healthcare, science, education and Jewish communities in Israel and around the world.”
Without those funds Elad would not have been able to so quickly and successfully pursue their goal of strengthening the Jewish presence in this Palestinian neighborhood.
Some of the houses where Elad settlers live were purchased from their previous Palestinian owners. But other Palestinian families were evicted from others, based on a controversial Israeli law titled “The Absentee Property Law.”
The law enables Israel to take over property of Palestinians who, according to Israel, have left or fled their houses during conflict.
At the center of one such case is the Sumarin house, which is located right next to Elad’s Visitor Center, where 19 family members currently live there, the youngest is less than two months old.
Amal Sumarin, mother of the family, said: “When I got married I moved here. My husband was living here with his uncle Haj Moussa Sumarin.” After his wife died, she remembered, “I started taking care of him, cooking and feeding him. My husband used to help him in the shower and used to take him to the doctor. He used to tell me this house is yours my child. It's for you and your husband.""
Moussa Sumarin passed away in 1983, and his house was claimed by the state of Israel under the absentee law in 1987. It was then sold to Hemnutah, a subsidiary of the Jewish National Fund (JNF.)
One of the JNF’s stated objectives is to buy and develop land on behalf of the Jewish people. In 1991 Hemnutah asked the court to evict the Sumarins from their home. With support and funding from NGOs and the Palestinian Authority, the Sumarin’s legal battle has continued since.
Mohammed Dahle, the Sumarin’s lawyer for 10 years, told the BBC that “the probability of the survival of a Palestinian property, after it’s been declared that it’s a Jewish or Israeli property...is most likely zero.”
And indeed, in August the family lost its appeal to Jerusalem’s District court. They are now appealing to Israel’s Supreme Court which will hear the case in April 2021. 
BBC News Arabic has found that Elad has been pushing forward the eviction by agreeing to pay all legal costs associated with the case, in a letter sent to Hemnutah in 1991, along with the eviction cases of several other families in the Silwan area. Hemnutah did not respond to questions about the case and Elad has not confirmed if they have continued to fund the case.
Elad said that all their properties have been gained fairly and legally. “No Palestinian has ever been removed from their home in the City of David without due process without court, without a case, without them being able to present their case on either side,” says Doron Spielman.
But Mohammed Dahle says, “It’s a situation where one ethnic group makes laws for its own interests, and another ethnic group suffers under these laws.”   
Elad’s influence has grown alongside its funding. US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is a strong supporter of Israeli settlements and has taken part in an opening ceremony at the City of David.
Friedman was one of the patrons of the 2019 US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. And in 2020, when President Trump announced his peace plan, it named many of Elad’s sites as historical or spiritual places in need of protection. All of which are in occupied territory.

"Elderly anti-occupation activist among five Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in the occupied territories""",9/21/20 14:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120278,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, September 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today detained at least five Palestinians, including an elderly anti-occupation activist, from various parts of the occupied territories, according to local sources.
Israeli forces detained 61-year-old Khairi Hannoun after storming his house in Anabta town, east of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm.
Hannoun made headlines last month after Israeli soldiers beat him and threw him to the ground as he participated in an anti-settlement and land grab protest in Shufa village, south of Tulkarm, while a soldier pressed his knee on his neck while on the ground, a scene reminiscent of the event that led to the death of African-American George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while detaining him on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Hannoun had spent a total of eight years in Israeli prisons for his anti-occupation activities.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces detained a Palestinian after ransacking his house in Hebron district in the south of the West Bank.
Soldiers conducted a similar raid in Deir Samet village, southwest of Hebron, resulting in the detention of another.
Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint west of the Ibrahimi Mosque in the city stopped and detained a minor.
In East Jerusalem, Israeli police detained a Palestinian during a raid in al-Issawiya neighborhood.

RAMALLAH, Monday, September 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Three young Palestinians said they were severely beaten by Israeli occupation soldiers after they were apprehended, today said the Prisoners’ Affairs Commission.
It said, based on an affidavit from Ahmad Alqam, 17, from Beit Ummar town, in the south of the West Bank, that after Israeli occupation soldiers had detained him during a dawn raid at his family home the soldiers beat him severely on his face and back along the way to Asqalan detention facility.
During the interrogation at the facility, the soldiers forced him to sit in a low chair with his hands and feet cuffed to the chair for long hours. He remained there for nine days before being transferred to Damoun detention facility, the commission said.
Meanwhile, the commission recounted the testimony of Mustafa Bayari, who was detained during a dawn raid at Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah.
Soldiers severely beat Bayari and banged his head across a wall several times. Then, they transferred him for interrogation at the infamous Russian compound detention facility in West Jerusalem where his interrogators deliberately assaulted and humiliated him, and detained him there for 38 days before moving him to the Ofer detention facility near Ramallah.
Bayari’s health condition has deteriorated after being tortured in detention, said the commission, and as a result, he is now suffering from acute head and ear pain besides to eyesight problems.
The commission also related the case of Abdullah Sobh, 19, a resident of Jenin city, who was detained at a military checkpoint near Tulkarm city.
It said Sobh was subject to arbitrary and indiscriminate beatings and interrogation at Huwwara detention facility where he remained in detention for 17 days before being transferred to Ofer military detention facility.

Hifthi Abu Sneineh, the director of the mosque, told WAFA that the Israeli occupation authorities closed the mosque on Saturday night in order to make way for Jewish settlers to celebrate Rosh Hashanah holiday, or the Jewish New Year.
Israel divided the Ibrahimi Mosque in 1994 between Muslims and Jews following the infamous massacre committed by a Jewish settler which left over 50 people dead. Prior to that time, it was an exclusive Muslim worship area.

"Settlers break into Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem """,9/20/20 10:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120262,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, September 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of hardcore Jewish fanatic settlers, heavily guarded by Israeli police, broke into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied Jerusalem today under the pretext of marking the Rosh Hashanah holiday, according to witnesses.
They said that the fanatic settlers entered the holy compound in groups since early morning and performed rituals and provocative tours through the Islamic holy site.
Over the past few days, the so-called Temple Mount extremist organizations called upon fans to perform provocative tours to Al-Aqsa, on the pretext of celebrating the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, or the Jewish New Year.
Settler incursions into the holy mosque compound coupled with the systematic takeover of church property in Jerusalem are perceived as part of the plan to transform a multi-religious and multi-cultural city into a “reunified” Jewish city under the exclusive control and sovereignty of the occupying state of Israel.
Located in occupied Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam. It was also Islam’s first Qibla, the direction towards which Muslims must turn to pray, before that was changed to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia.

NABLUS, Saturday, September 19, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces ordered today the confiscation of 803 dunums of Palestinian land near the village of Duma, to the south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to local sources.

"Occupation authorities to expel wife of a Palestinian citizen of Jerusalem""",9/19/20 17:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120256,"
RAMALLAH, Saturday, September 19, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities have ordered the expulsion of the wife of a Palestinian citizen of occupied Jerusalem, under the pretext of not holding the status of a permanent citizen of the city, according to activist Amjad Abu Asab, an official who monitors the affairs of the Jerusalem's political prisoners in Israeli detention.
He said Mariam Ajlouni, the wife of Mohammad Jabr Ajlouni, a Palestinian citizen of the occupied city, was told by Israeli occupation police that she had two weeks to appeal against the order or that she will have to leave the city.
Ajlouni, a mother of four children, is one of many Palestinian citizens of occupied Jerusalem facing the risk of expulsion by the occupation authorities, whose discriminatory rules ban the reunion of wives married to Palestinian citizens from the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem live in an area classified as an internationally recognized Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.

Morad Shtewi, coordinator of the popular resistance in the village, said Israeli soldiers fired live bullets, rubber-coated rounds and teargas canisters towards the protesters, injuring three of them, including a journalist identified as Mohammad Fawzi.
Several other protesters suffocated from teargas inhalation.
For many years, Palestinians have been organizing weekly protests in the village of Kafr Qaddum to demonstrate against Israel's continued closure of the village's main entrance, as well against the growing colonial Israeli settlement activities.

The four worshipers had just performed the weekly Friday prayer when they were detained by the occupation police at the Lions Gate, on the northeast entrance of the holy compound.
The occupying state of Israel captured the east part of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 and later annexed it in 1982 in a move that was never recognized by the international community.

"Settlers chop down olive trees in Nablus-district village""",9/18/20 12:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120243,"
NABLUS, Friday, September 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today chopped down dozens of olive trees in As-Sawiya village, south of Nablus city, according to a local municipal source.
Head of As-Sawiya Village Council Murad Abu Ras said that the villagers were shocked to find out in the morning that dozens of their olive trees were chopped down by settlers from the nearby Israeli colonial settlement of Rechalim.
Abu Ras added that settlers have been frequently targeting Palestinian olive groves in the village, and destroying centuries-old olive trees.
Settler attacks intensify as Palestinian farmers start the olive harvesting season. Attacks are mainly in the northern villages near Nablus and Salfit districts, which have the largest concentration of colonial settlements.
With more than 12 million olive trees planted across 45% of the West Bank’s agricultural land, the olive harvest constitutes one of the biggest sources of economic sustainability for thousands of Palestinian families.
According to UN OCHA, the olive oil industry supports the livelihoods of more than 100,000 families and accounts for a quarter of the gross agricultural income of the occupied territories.
But, as local NGO MIFTAH notes, “olive trees carry more than an economic significance in the lives of Palestinians. They are not just like any other trees, they are symbolic of Palestinians’ attachment to their land.”
“Because the trees are drought-resistant and grow under poor soil conditions, they represent Palestinian resistance and resilience. The fact that olive trees live and bear fruit for thousands of years is parallel to Palestinian history and continuity on the land.”
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers‘ violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

He said an occupation army force raided a ranch belonging to Mr. Mohammad Abdel-Aziz Qaquor, where they demolished a number of shacks used for farming purposes. The raiding force also shut down a number of dirt roads serving the local Palestinian farmers in the area.
In the meantime, the Israeli occupation army ordered a Palestinian citizen of the village of Taqu, near Bethlehem, to stop the ongoing construction of his home in the village, under the pretext of lacking an Israeli construction permit.
Faisal Mohammad Omour said the occupation army also confiscated a concrete mixer which was used by workers at the construction site. He said he was threatened by the soldiers not to resume the construction works or that he would be prosecuted by the Israeli authorities.

"Repression forces raid cells, assault Palestinian prisoners in Megiddo""",9/17/20 11:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120234,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, September 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli repression forces last night raided cells of Palestinian prisoners and assaulted and injured many of them in the Israeli prison of Megiddo, said the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS).
According to the PPS, the raid occurred after a large group of prisoners were forcefully moved by the occupation authorities from Gilboa to Megiddo prison, during which the Megiddo prison director broke into a hassle with one of the prisoners. The hassle reportedly developed into a large-scale raid by the special prison forces and commandos.
The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) has recently escalated its aggressive raid attacks against Palestinian prisoners, most notably in the prisons of Ofer, Megiddo, and Gilboa. In addition, the Israeli prison authorities escalated the policy of moving prisoners from one prison to another.
Last Sunday, Israeli commandos accompanied by attack dogs raided the cells of the Palestinian political detainees at Ofer Detention Center, southwest of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, and assaulted and injured many of them.
The PPS said that the systematic transfer of prisoners between prisons aims to keep the prisoners in a state of chaos and instability, as well as to keep them always under pressure.

BEERSHEBA, Thursday, September 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities today demolished all shelters in the Palestinian Bedouin village of al-Araqib in the Naqab desert, south of Israel, for the 178th time since the year 2000 and for the seventh time this year, according to local sources.
Israeli police broke into the village and tore down the tents and the shanties used as shelters by the local Bedouin residents, leaving them, including children, homeless.
The village was last leveled on August 27, and every time the residents rebuild their tents and the rudimentary shacks, Israeli police return to raze them.
Located in the Naqab desert, the village is one of 51 “unrecognized” Arab villages in the area and is constantly targeted for demolition. Israeli bulldozers, which Bedouins are charged for, have demolished everything, from the trees to the water tanks, but Bedouin residents have tried to rebuild it every time.
Although Bedouins in the Naqab, who hold the Israeli nationality, abide by the same laws and pay taxes as other Israeli citizens, they do not enjoy the same rights and services as Jews in Israel. In addition, the Israeli government has repeatedly refused to connect their towns to the national water and electricity networks in an effort to end their presence in that area of the country.

RAMALLAH, Thursday, September 17, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation army demolished a Palestinian-owned home today in the village of Beit Sira, to the west of the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, under the pretext of construction without a permit, according to a local source. 
Walid Khattab, deputy mayor of Beit Sira, said an occupation army force accompanied by heavy machinery raided the village in the early dawn hours, cordoned off the home of Mr. Mohammad Ismail Anqawi, a local Palestinian villager, before proceeding to knock it down.
Anqawi was notified by the Israeli occupation authorities two months ago that his home would be demolished for lack of an Israeli construction permit. He said he had since obtained an Israeli court order to delay the demolition, but was shocked that the occupation army decided to demolish the home despite the court's ruling.
Israeli occupation authorities have already handed over notifications for the demolition of 40 other homes in the area, under the pretext of building without an Israeli permit.
The location where the house was demolished is located in an area classified Area C, an area making two-thirds of the occupied West Bank that is under Israeli civil and military control, and where the occupation authorities almost never issue any construction permits to the Palestinian citizens. 
This reality has forced hundreds of Palestinians in this area to build without a permit in order to fulfill their growing housing demands, risking their homes be demolished by the occupation authorities.

"Israeli forces detain 13 Palestinians from the West Bank""",9/17/20 10:12,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120231,"
RAMALLAH, Thursday, September 17, 2020 (WAFA) – At least 13 Palestinians were detained last night by Israeli occupation forces, during wide-scale raids and search operations in several areas in the occupied West Bank.
In the Hebron district, south of the West Bank, the occupation soldiers detained six Palestinians in Hebron City and the nearby town of Yatta. 
In the district of Jenin, north of the West Bank, the occupation forces detained four Palestinians, including two brothers and two former prisoners, after raiding and ransacking their homes.
Israeli forces also detained two people from the Tulkarm district, and one from the Ramallah district.
Almost on a daily basis and especially at nighttime, Israeli occupation forces raid towns and villages in the occupied West Bank to carry out arrests or summon civilians for questioning. This has become part of the daily life under Israeli military regime for decades.

BETHLEHEM, Thursday, September 17, 2020 (WAFA) – Extremist Israeli settlers proceeded today to fence off lands they seized in the village of Kisan, to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, local sources said.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem, Hasan Breijeh, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal Israeli settlement of  Avne Hanahel fenced off about 20 donums of land that they seized last month. The land is located to the southwest of the aforementioned village.
He noted that the Israeli authorities seized a month ago about 660 donums of land in Kisan and prevented its owners from accessing and planting it, as they also opened a settler-only road and installed four mobile homes.
The village of Kisan has been a regular target for the Israeli settlers and army. A few days ago, Israeli forces today issued demolition orders against several structures in the village.

"Israeli forces seize bulldozer north of Tubas""",9/16/20 12:01,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120221,"
TUBAS, Wednesday, September 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces last night seized a Palestinian-owned bulldozer in Khirbet Ibziq, north of Tubas city, local sources said.
Aref Daraghmeh, a human rights activist, told WAFA that Israeli forces seize the bulldozers as the heavy machinery was working on reclaiming a plot of land belonging Osama Awaisa in Khirbet Ibziq.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israel strikes several sites in Gaza, no injuries""",9/16/20 09:32,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120217,"
GAZA, Wednesday, September 16, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes dawn Wednesday carried out a series of airstrikes against several sites across the besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent. 
He confirmed that an Israeli F-16 fighter jet targeted with three missiles a site, northwest of Khan Younes city, in the southern besieged enclave, causing extensive material damage to nearby civilian property.
Israeli attack jets also pounded another site, east of the northeast of Gaza city, and another to the west of Deir al-Balah city, reducing the sites to rubble and causing damage to nearby civilian houses.
This came as fighter jets carried out another raid on a site, north of Beit Lahia town in the northern besieged enclave, reducing it to ruins and spreading panic among residents.
No human casualties were reported in any of the attacks.
Israel claimed that the airstrikes came in retaliation to rocket firing from Gaza towards southern Israel.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, September 15, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli army is holding military exercises in inhabited Palestinian areas in the West Bank’s Jordan Valley, today said Aref Daraghme, a human rights defender.
He told WAFA that the army started the exercises yesterday afternoon in Khirbet al-Shaq, Khirbet Samra and Khirbet Oheish in the northern Jordan Valley.
The army used heavy machinery in the exercises inside cultivated land and near the residential tents of local dwellers, he said, which places the lives and livelihood of people under threat.
Rights organizations have often accused the army of leaving behind explosives and other dangerous material that pose a threat to the lives of children and other civilians, in addition to destroying crops during the exercises.
They also accused Israel of using the military exercises as a pretext to drive Palestinians off their lands and homes.

"Israeli police storm Jerusalem’s Bab al-Rahma prayer area """,9/14/20 16:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120196,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, September 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli police Monday afternoon stormed Bab al-Rahma prayer area inside Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
The Islamic Religious Endowments (Waqf) Department said that police barged their way into the site and took photos for it, a step that provoked Palestinian worshipers inside.
In 2019, tension escalated over this section of the mosque compound when Israeli police closed its gate with chains and locks, a step that was perceived by Palestinian Muslims as a harbinger to the division of the mosque compound and allocation of the eastern section for Israeli Jewish settlers.
Palestinian Muslim worshipers protested the closure, and eventually opened Bab al-Rahma, which was shuttered by Israeli since 2003, and used it as a prayer area.
Messianic Jewish settlers are hoping to establish an increased presence on the site of the Al-Aqsa mosque, among the most important Muslim shrines in the world and potent symbols of Palestinian nationalism, and calling for building a third temple on what they term the “Temple Mount”.
Their far-right beliefs were once considered a small fringe movement, but in recent years, they have found favor in the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, receiving the endorsement of many lawmakers.
Settlers incursions into the mosque compound coupled with the takeover of church property in Jerusalem are perceived as part of the plan to transform a multi-religious and multi-cultural city into a “reunified” Jewish city under the exclusive control and sovereignty of Israel.

"Israel to demolish a Palestinian house in south of West Bank sheltering a family of 10 people""",9/14/20 12:50,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120192,"
HEBRON, Monday, September 14, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli military government today issued a demolition order against a Palestinian house in the village of al-Tuwwana, in Masafer Yatta in the south of the occupied West Bank, sheltering a family of 10 people, said local sources.
Israeli soldiers raided the village and informed Mahmoud Abu Aram that his 65-square-meter house where he lives with his family of 10, will be demolished alleging it was built without a permit.
Meanwhile, another resident of Al-Tuwwana was also informed by the army to halt construction on his house under the same pretext.
Mohammad Rabei, head of al-Tuwwana village council, told WAFA that these orders aim to force Palestinians out of their lands, which they inherited from their parents and grandparents and have legal land ownership deeds, in order to expand nearby illegal Israeli settlement built on seized Palestinian land.

"Human Rights Watch calls on Israel to release body of slain Palestinian held for over 10 weeks""",9/14/20 12:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120191,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, September 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli authorities have held the body of a Palestinian man, Ahmad Erekat, for more than 10 weeks after Israeli soldiers killed him seemingly without justification at a checkpoint, in violation of international humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today.
Video footage shows Erekat’s car crashing into a checkpoint in the West Bank on June 23, knocking over an Israeli soldier, and then Israeli forces shooting him after he emerged from his car in circumstances in which he no longer appeared to pose an imminent threat to life.
Israeli authorities have held Erekat’s body ever since and said in a September 7 court filing that they would not return it to his family. The filing follows their reported decision on September 2 to continue withholding the bodies of dozens of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in what they consider security incidents, many unaffiliated with any political or armed group, in large part as leverage to secure the release of Israelis held by Hamas in Gaza.
“After fatally shooting Ahmad Erekat without apparent justification, Israeli authorities have unlawfully held his body hostage for more than 10 weeks,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “Preventing Erekat’s family from burying their son in a dignified manner is cruel and without legal justification.”
Israeli authorities did not indicate that Erekat was armed, or whether they are investigating the killing. Human Rights Watch wrote to the Israeli border police to solicit more information and their perspective on Erekat’s killing and the decision to withhold his body, but has not received a response.
Israeli authorities for decades have used excessive force against Palestinians in policing situations, when lesser means could have been used, said HRW. Less than a month before the Erekat killing, on May 30, Israeli border police fatally shot an unarmed 32-year-old Palestinian man with autism, Eyad al-Hallaq, while he was on a morning walk to a center for people with special needs in the Old City of Jerusalem.
More than 80 days after the killing, Israeli authorities continue to hold Erekat’s body. The authorities initially told the Erekat family that they would hand over his body the day after the killing, but, hours later, they called back and informed the family they would hold on to the body for “political considerations,” according to a petition filed to the Israeli Supreme Court calling for the return of Erekat’s body by the human rights group Adalah on the family’s behalf.
Israel currently holds the bodies of 67 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since 2015, according to the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC). In 2017, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the state has no legal basis to withhold bodies.

"Unlawful demolitions in the West Bank spike during COVID-19: UN""",9/11/20 10:13,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/120158,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, September 11, 2020 (WAFA) – The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and Resident Coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, said yesterday that the period from March to August 2020 saw the demolition or confiscation of 389 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank, on average, 65 per month, the highest average destruction rate in four years.
He said in a statement that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli authorities indicated that they would restrain their longstanding policy of demolishing inhabited Palestinian homes. ""Sadly, demolitions during the period March-August 2020 left 442 Palestinians homeless, further exposing many to risks associated with the pandemic. In August alone, 205 people were displaced, more than in any other single month since January 2017,"" he said.
""Beyond homes, the targeted properties included water, hygiene or sanitation assets, and structures used for agriculture, among others, undermining the access of many to livelihoods and services. Moreover, 50 of the structures had been given to Palestinians as humanitarian aid, and their destruction hit the most vulnerable of all, and undermined emergency operations,"" McGoldrick added.
""Of specific concern is the Israeli authorities' increased use of an expedited procedure (Order 1797) for the removal of structures as soon as 96 hours after delivering a notice, largely preventing owners from being heard before a judicial body,"" added the UN Resident Coordinator.
He continued, ""When the Israeli authorities demolish, or force people to demolish, homes and sources of livelihood, they typically cite a lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain, due to the restrictive and discriminatory planning regime, and leaves them no venues for authorized construction.""
""Moreover, the demolition of essential structures during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly worrying as it further compounds the overall situation in the West Bank.""
McGoldrick concluded, ""The global pandemic has increased the needs and vulnerabilities of Palestinians, who are already trapped in the abnormality of prolonged military occupation. Unlawful demolitions exacerbate these vulnerabilities and must stop immediately"".

NABLUS, Thursday, September 10, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Thursday overnight attacked Palestinian vehicles on the road connecting the West Bank cities of Jenin and Nablus, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors colonial settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told WAFA that a group of settlers attacked vehicles  traveling on the Nablus-Jenin Road, also known as Route 60, close to the former colonial settlement of Homesh, evacuated in 2005, smashing the glass windshields of over ten of them.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Since the signing of the Oslo Accords, Palestinians have not been able to travel freely on Route 60, which is spotted with Israeli checkpoints when the road passes from areas under Palestinian control to areas under Israeli military control.
In addition to the checkpoints, Israel has established several ‘bypass roads’, enabling Israeli traffic to bypass areas of Route 60 that passed through Palestinian jurisdiction.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.

"Israel restricts movement of Jerusalem's Palestinian governor to his hometown""",9/9/20 21:31,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119169,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, September 09, 2020 (WAFA) - The Israeli occupation authorities today restricted the movement of the Palestinian Authority's Governor of Jerusalem, Adnan Ghaith, to his hometown, Silwan, and prohibited him from being in contact with more than 50 people, including President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh.
A statement issued by the governor's office considered this decision a dangerous and unprecedented measure against the governor of Jerusalem, who represents President Abbas, saying it comes in the context of the Israeli occupation's battle to impose Israeli sovereignty over occupied Jerusalem by abolishing and ending the Palestinian presence in the holy city.
Since his appointment as governor of Jerusalem two years ago, Ghaith was detained more than 17 times, summoned for investigation dozens of times, and handed four military orders banning him from entering the West Bank, communicating with a list of national figures, and preventing him from participation in social events and occasions, and provision of humanitarian aid.

GAZA ,  Wednesday, September 09, 2020 (WAFA) –Israeli  military vehicles today infiltrated  Gaza’s border, east of  Gaza city, and razed farmland, according to WAFA correspondent. 
He said that Israeli military vehicles advanced several dozens of meters into Gaza’s eastern frontier, east of Gaza city, razing farmlands and placed dirt mounds while opening fire in the air.
Meanwhile, Israeli navy opened fire and water hoses towards fishermen sailing within three nautical miles offshore Gaza city, forcing them to flee to the shore.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

RAMALLAH, Wednesday, September 09, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military bulldozers today uprooted 22 olive trees Ras Karkar village, west of Ramallah city, according to local sources.
Nu‘man Nofal, a farmer from the village, told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces uprooted trees from his 50-donum land located in Ras Abu Zeitoun area, northeast of the village, to make room for the construction of a settler-only road.
He added that he is denied access to his land, which the military has fenced off with barbed wire and installed a metal gate at its entrance,  unsless he has an Israeli permit. 
Nofal said that he was able to reclaim his land by planting it with trees the last year, before it was razed. 
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The number of settlers has almost tripled since the Oslo Accords of 1993, when settlers’ number estimated 252,000. Illegal colonial settlements have leapt from 144 to 515 in that time.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the colonial settlements is a “national interest.”

The sources told WAFA that Israeli forces raided Bani Na'im town, east of Hebron, where they took photos and measurements of slain Palestinian Mohammad Naser Tarayra as a prelude to punitevly demolish it.
Israeli military demolished the internal walls of the first floor of Tarayra's house back in  August 2016.
Tarayra, 17, was killed by Israeli military gunfire on June 30, 2016 for stabbing an Israeli settler to death in the colonial settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers barged their way into al-Ramadin village, southwest of Hebron, where they handed three residents military orders to demolish their houses.
Israel resorts to punitively demolish the family homes of any Palestinians – as means of deterrence - accused of being involved in attacks against Israelis, a policy that Israel does not use against Israeli settlers who were involved in fatal attacks against Palestinians.
This policy was widely condemned by human rights organizations as “collective punishment” and “a war crime and a crime against humanity”.

HEBRON, Monday, September 7, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli occupation forces today razed large areas of Palestinian-owned lands located near an illegal Israeli settlement in the south of the occupied West Bank, witnesses and local sources told WAFA.
They said Israeli occupation forces raided an area known as Khirbet Zanouta, near the illegal Israeli settlement of Shimaa, as army bulldozers proceeded to raze lands owned by local families.
It is believed Israel destroys the land to prevent its owners from reclaiming it and therefore take it over and join it to nearby settlements.
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces also razed land and destroyed water networks near Tuwwaneh village in Masafer Yatta, also in the south of the West Bank.

RAMALLAH, Sunday, September 6, 2020 (WAFA) – The Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs Commission said yesterday that Ahmad and Mohammad Jadoun, who were critically injured and dragged by Israeli occupation forces from their home in Jenin refugee camp earlier on the day, are in a critical health condition.
Khaled Mahajneh, an attorney of the Commission, said the two brothers are currently hospitalized in an Israeli hospital in Afula. He said Mohammad is still unconscious as he lost a significant amount of blood due to the injury he sustained in the left leg. He underwent an immediate surgery to remove some of the shrapnel in his leg, and is expected to undergo another surgery today.
Mohammad's brother, Ahmed, was also placed in the ICU on Saturday afternoon due to his severe injury in the face and neck, which was described as stable but critical. He underwent two surgeries and is expected to undergo other surgeries during the upcoming days.
Earlier yesterday, Israeli occupation soldiers opened fire as they broke into the home of the Jadoun family, injuring the two brothers as they were sleeping before taking them into custody.
Activists posted several videos on social media of the two injured brothers being carried by Israeli soldiers after the raid.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, September 6, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israeli settlers demonstrated last night and early today morning in occupied Jerusalem demanding embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, marking the latest in a months-long campaign demanding him to resign. 
The protests were the latest in a months-long weekend rallies demanding Netanyahu's resignation over corruption charges and mishandling the coronavirus outbreak.
Thousands of protesters took part in the main demonstration outside Netanyahu's residence in occupied Jerusalem demanding him to step down. Protesters held banners reading ""Revolution"" and ""Get out of here"" and held blue-and-white Israeli flags. A sign aimed at the prime minister was projected on a building reading in Hebrew: ""Enough with you.""
Protests also erupted in other areas across the country, including at junctions and overpasses.
Israeli police have clashed with protesters on several occasions and used water cannons to clear them off main streets and squares, though in recent weeks the gatherings have been calmer but larger.
Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office despite being charged last year with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations.

It said in its monthly report on Israeli measures against the Palestinian population of the occupied city that the Israeli occupation municipality of West Jerusalem escalated in August its policy of demolishing Palestinian homes and facilities in East Jerusalem in an unprecedented manner under the pretext of building without a permit despite the difficult economic conditions in the city due to the Corona pandemic and the high number of cases in all sections of the occupied city.
It said it had monitored the demolition of 51 facilities in East Jerusalem, most of which were inhabited housing units, including 36 housing units, part of one house, five commercial establishments, two house foundations, and seven agricultural shacks.
It said 27 of the demolitions were self-destroyed by their owners under pressure from the municipality, while the rest were demolished by the occupation municipality.
The demolitions were concentrated in Silwan, with 16 facilities, and 13 facilities in Jabal al Mukaber, most of which were homes and housing units.
The center stated that the demolitions had left more than 85 people homeless, most of them children under the age of 18.

The protesters chanted slogans praising yesterday's meeting of the secretary-generals of the Palestinians factions, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which laid the ground for joint national action towards the fulfillment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. 
For many years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.

"Pregnant woman among four injured in settler attack northeast of Ramallah""",9/4/20 09:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119097,"
 
RAMALLAH, Friday, September 4, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers late Wednesday attacked a Palestinian vehicle with stones near Turmusayya town, northeast of Ramallah, injuring four passengers, including a pregnant woman, medical sources said.
The sources confirmed that settlers pelted a Palestinian vehicle as it was traveling along the road near the town with stones, injuring four passengers and causing extensive material damage.
The four casualties, including a nine-month pregnant who was seriously injured, were rushed to the Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah.
They were identified as residents of Kafr Malek, northeast of Ramllah.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

JERUSALEM, Thursday, September 3, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today handed a former Palestinian prisoner from occupied East Jerusalem a notice informing him of their intention to revoke his residency rights in the holy city, according to a local source.
Amjad Abu Asab, head of the Committee of Families of Prisoners from Jerusalem, said that the occupation authorities informed Salah Hamouri that he would be stripped from his Jerusalem residency rights, nothing that he has 30 days to object to this order.
Hamouri spent about eight years in Israeli jails for resisting its occupation. He is married to a French woman who was deported by Israel in 2016.

RAMALLAH, Thursday, September 3, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today detained at least 10 Palestinians, including a father of four, from various parts of the occupied Palestinian territories, according to local sources.
Ahmad Zahran, 44, from Deir Abu Mashaal village, northwest of Ramallah, and father of four children who spent a total of 15 years in Israeli detention, was detained following a raid at his home. He was released from prison on July 30 after spending 18 months in administrative detention and launching a hunger strike against his administrative detention that lasted 113 days.
In Tulkarm district, the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said Israeli occupation forces detained a Palestinian after breaking into his house in Balaa town, northeast of the city.
They also conducted two separate raids in the city and Nur Shams refugee camp, resulting in the detention of two others.
Meanwhile, two other Palestinians were detained in a raid in Tubas district.
In Nablus district, Israeli forces detained two others after thoroughly searching their houses in separate raids in Asira al-Shamaliya and Burin towns, north and south of the city respectively.
In Jenin district, Israeli soldiers detained a Palestinian man from Jenin refugee camp.
They also detained a resident of Silat Ad-Dhahr town, southwest of Jenin, after stopping him at a military checkpoint near Yaabad town, west of the city.
(Updated on 13:50 Palestine time: Later reports said the army released Zahran after questioning him for several hours.)

"Israeli cabinet says it will not return bodies of Palestinians to their families for burial""",9/2/20 20:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119081,"
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, September 02, 2020 (WAFA) - Israel’s security cabinet announced today that it would not allow the return of the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli occupation forces to their families for burial.
Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, which is representing the family of Ahmad Erekat in the Israeli Supreme Court petition demanding the return of his body for burial, issued a response this evening to the security cabinet’s decision:
""The Israeli security cabinet’s decision to withhold the bodies of Palestinians is extremely problematic and is driven clearly by motivations for vengeance. The policy of using human bodies as bargaining chips violates the most basic universal values and international law which prohibit cruel and inhuman treatment. This position has indeed already been supported by three Israeli Supreme Court justices. This is an extreme and barbaric policy and there is no country in the world that would adopt it. Israel’s Supreme Court will now demand an examination of Israel’s continued withholding of bodies and seek the legal justification for the continued suffering of Palestinian families affected by this decision. Adalah will continue to work against any policy of collective punishment.""
Ahmad Erekat was shot dead by Israeli Border Police officers at the ""Container"" checkpoint in Abu Dis outside of Jerusalem on June 23.
Israeli authorities confiscated Erekat's body following the killing and have since refused to return him to his family for burial.
Adalah has been leading the battle in the Israeli Supreme Court aimed at compelling Israeli authorities to return the body of 27-year-old Ahmad Erekat and filed a petition on June 30.
In the petition, Adalah Attorney Sawsan Zaher argued that Israeli authorities are withholding Erekat's body without authority and that every person has the constitutional right to be buried with dignity and within a short period of time following his or her death. The right of the deceased to be buried and the right of a family to bury its child are established in Israel's Basic Law – Human Dignity and Liberty, and via a series of Israeli Supreme Court decisions.
""Withholding the body of a deceased individual is against the law,"" Adalah wrote in the petition. ""There is no [Israeli] law that allows the withholding of a body without at least stating the reason for doing so. There is, likewise, no law that allows authorities to refrain from providing information to the deceased's family.""
Mustafa Erekat, the father of Ahmad Erekat, reflected on the situation when the petition was filed:
“Withholding Ahmad's body is an inhumane act that multiplies many times over the torture that our family is now experiencing. Ahmad’s mother and his sisters have not stopped crying since his execution.""
Withholding the body of a deceased individual from his or her family also constitutes a violation of international law, most notably the international convention prohibiting torture and cruel and inhumane treatment of human beings.
Indeed, the United Nations Committee Against Torture called on Israel in June 2016 to take all necessary steps to return bodies to families for burial as soon as possible.
According to Palestinian human rights organizations, Israel is withholding bodies of more than 60 Palestinians killed by Israeli occupation forces in recent years under the pretext of being used as ""bargaining chips"" in potential prisoner swaps. In addition, around 250 bodies of Palestinians, also killed by Israelis, are kept in numbered graves in cemeteries in the north of Israel, some withheld since the start of the Israeli occupation in 1967.

HEBRON, Wednesday, September 02, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli military government handed today demolition orders against five Palestinian homes in the southern West Bank village of Birin in Masafer Yatta, according to a local official.
Rateb al-Jabour, Coordinator of the Nationalist and Popular Committees for the Resistance Against the Wall and Settlements, said the Israeli military gave the five families 96 hours before it is going to proceed with the demolitions.
He said the decision is part of a larger Israeli plan to empty that area of its Palestinian residents and build illegal settlements.

"Israeli forces seize tents in Ramallah-district community""",9/2/20 14:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119076,"
 
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, September 02, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today seized three tents from the Bedouin community of Wadi al-Seeq located to the northeast of Ramallah, local sources said.
Fares Ka‘abneh, a community member, told WAFA that a large Israeli military force raided the community, established on rented land belonging to the adjacent towns of Deir Dibwan, Rammun and Taybeh, and dismantled three tents belonging to Ka‘abneh clan, a week after the clan received them as donations from human rights organizations.
Two days ago, an Israeli occupation force surveyed the area in preparation for more demolitions only a few days after demolishing eight makeshift structures at the site.
As one of 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities at the risk of forcible transfer in the northeastern Ramallah district, Wadi al-Seeq is a home of some 150 people, 62 percent of whom are children, and their flock, as housed in approximately 100 makeshift structures.
They depend on the sale of their dairy products and wool in local markets for their livelihood. They are neither connected to water or electricity networks and rely on the costly delivery of water tanks (4x the cost of piped tariffs) and solar panels.
The community was expelled from their lands in the Naqab in 1948 to the Jordan Valley, becoming refugees, and eventually settled in Wadi al-Seeq, where they have resided in the West Bank prior to its occupation in 1967 or the designation of certain lands as “C” following the Oslo Accords, as confirmed by the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC).
“Yet, the community, as all Bedouin communities in the West Bank, has been continuously targeted by the State of Israel for its presence in key areas earmarked for effective annexation (i.e. the Jordan Valley and the Jerusalem periphery).”
The community falls along the Alon settlement road (Road No. 458) connecting the colonial settlement blocs in the vicinity to each other; Kochav Hashachar, Rimonim and Ma’ale Michmash, on route to the Jordan Valley. Its vulnerability to forceful displacement is exacerbated by the footpaths frequented by Israeli hikers and violent settlers.
It first received blanket demolition orders issued by the Israeli Civil Administration, the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank, in 1996 on alleged grounds that the vicinity was a “closed military training zone”. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled at the time that the communities’ structures (save for the three structures furthest East) do not pose a “threat” to the State of Israel and may continue to be situated in their vicinities.
The community received a new batch of demolition orders in October and November of 2018, and another batch in May of 2019, including a demolition order against the community’s sole elementary school, built with European Union donor funding, a step that prompted the EU to deplore the continuing threat of demolitions and seizures of Palestinian structures.
The community received a third batch of demolition orders in May 2020, with 34 new orders against housing and livelihood structures.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
While Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israel tears down two inhabited houses, shack south of Hebron""",9/2/20 12:30,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119073,"
 
HEBRON, Wednesday, September 02, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces Wednesday morning tore down two inhabited Palestinian houses and a shack in Masafer Yatta town in the southern Hebron hills, according to local sources.
Coordinator for the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committee Rateb al-Jabour said that Israeli forces  escorted bulldozers into Khirbet Jinba, one of the cluster of hamlets making up Masafer Yatta, where the heavy machineries knocked down the two inhabited houses, each occupying an area of 60 square meters, purportedly for being built without a rarely-issued Israeli permit. 
The demolished houses belonged to Mahmoud Rab‘i, and his brother, Fadel, and housed their families comprising 16 members, who are now homeless.
Meanwhile , the bulldozers proceeded to demolish a livestock shack belonging to two bothers citing the same pretext.
Masafer Yatta is a collection of almost 19 hamlets which rely heavily on animal husbandry as the main source of livelihood.
Located in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli administrative and military control, the area has been subjected to repeated Israeli violations by settlers and soldiers targeting their main source of living - livestock.
It has been designated as a closed Israeli military zone for training since 1980s and accordingly referred to as Firing Zone 918.
Israeli violations against the area include demolition of animal barns, homes and residential structures. Issuance of construction permits by Israel to local Palestinians in the area is non-existent.
Israeli refuses to permit virtually any Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.

"Israeli forces demolish structures in Hebron""",9/2/20 12:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119072,"
 
RAMALLAH, Wednesday, August 26, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Wednesday morning demolished an agricultural room and a water well close to al-Fhas area, south of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local sources said.
The sources confirmed that Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer to Wadi al- ‘Aawar, located close to al-Fahs area, classified as Area C, where the heavy machinery tore down an agricultural room and a rainwater collection well belonging to Faraj Ghaith.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Israeli forces shoot, injure Palestinian at major checkpoint near Nablus""",9/2/20 09:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119070,"
 
NABLUS, Wednesday, September 02, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces shot and injured a Palestinian man at Zaatara checkpoint, south of Nablus city, medical sources said.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) medics confirmed that Israeli forces manning Zaatara checkpoint, also known to Israelis as Tappuah, opened fire at a vehicle, injuring and moderately injuring a Palestinian man.
PRCS medics were prevented from providing medical treatment to the man, who was left to bleed.
Witnesses said that Israeli soldiers temporarily closed the checkpoint to Palestinian traffic in both directions. 
Meanwhile, Israeli police spokesman claimed that the man, who was not identified, was shot after he attempted to carry out a car-ramming and stabbing attack. 
The police statement said that following the alleged attack, police officers were in light conditions and the alleged assailant was in moderate condition.
The circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear and largely based on the Israeli version of events.
Though Israeli military has claimed that Palestinians were allegedly attempting to carry out attacks, in a majority of instances when Palestinians were killed human rights groups have disputed Israel’s version of events, arguing that many alleged attackers could have been subdued in a non-lethal manner.

"Respecting fundamental rights in Gaza is pre-condition to achieving peace, says UN human rights expert""",9/1/20 19:12,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119068,"
GENEVA, Tuesday, September 01, 2020, (WAFA) – A United Nations human rights expert today expressed deep concerns about the recent rise in armed violence in Gaza, and has welcomed the announcement on Monday that Israel and Hamas have reached a truce to halt the current hostilities.
However, Michael Lynk, special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, cautioned that true peace, and the badly-needed reconstruction of Gaza, will only come with full respect of the fundamental rights of the two million Palestinians living there.
“Gaza has been reduced to a humanitarian whisper,” said Lynk. “Behind the current hostilities – the launching of rockets and incendiary balloons by Palestinian armed groups and the disproportionate use of targeted missile strikes by Israel – is the long-term impoverishment of Gaza by Israel’s 13-year-old comprehensive blockade. This amounts to collective punishment of the entire civilian population in Gaza, which adds immeasurably to the suffering of Gazans and wider tensions in the region.” 
In August, Israel closed the fishing zone off Gaza, largely shuttered the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing – the only commercial crossing into Gaza – and halted fuel supplies to the territory. This fuel embargo has caused Gaza’s sole power plant to shut down, reducing electricity availability to between four to six hours a day across the Strip and restricting operations at its sewage treatment plants, and diminishing the supply of water to homes.
“Instead of meaningful steps to end the blockade of Gaza to relieve civilians, Israel has maintained its tight grip. We are no longer on the edge of a humanitarian crisis, but in the middle of one. This is purely a human-made disaster, and could be quickly reversed if the political will existed,” said Lynk.
“This blockade has no meaningful security rationale,” he added. “It inflicts great misery on the two million civilians in Gaza while imposing little harm on any security targets. Israel remains the occupying power, and international law – including Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention – strictly forbids the use of collective punishment by the occupier.”
As a result of this prolonged blockade, Gaza’s two million residents endure a collapsing health care system, undrinkable and unaffordable water, inadequate and sporadic power supplies, an economy on its back, deep poverty and among the world’s highest unemployment rates, said Lynk. 
“Gaza is on the verge of becoming unlivable. There is no comparable situation in the world where a substantial population has endured such a permanent lockdown, largely unable to travel or trade, and controlled by an occupying power in breach of its solemn international human rights and humanitarian obligations. Our international standards of dignity and morality do not allow such experiments in human despair.”
An emerging concern is the new appearance of community transmission of Covid-19 in Gaza. Perversely, Gaza’s misfortune to be a blockaded territory has meant that, until now, the global pandemic has not entered the territory in any numbers.
“Should the Covid-19 pandemic take root in Gaza, the consequences would likely be very serious,” he said. “While the international community has been providing the medical supplies to deal with the pandemic, Gaza lacks the health care infrastructure – particularly regarding hospital capacity and the quantity of health professionals, testing kits and respiratory equipment – to manage a widespread outbreak. The cutting of fuel supplies by Israel throughout August makes a humanitarian crisis even worse.”
Lynk said what Gaza requires are not temporary band-aids but an end to the blockade – as repeatedly called for by the international community – and tools to chart the course to economic development and self-determination with the rest of Palestine. “Providing Gazans with hope for the future and a genuine path to prosperity and freedom will go a long way to answering Israel’s security concerns.”
Beyond lifting the blockade, he called for the construction of a Gaza seaport, building of new power, water and sewage treatment plants, access for the Palestinian Authority to the Gaza Marine natural gas field off Gaza’s coast, a substantial increase in export permits from Gaza and work permits in Israel, an industrial zone, the entry of much larger quantities of construction materials, and freedom of movement for Gazans.
“The announced truce has to be the first step towards the full realization of human rights in Gaza, and not another temporary step waiting for the next round of hostilities,” Lynk said.

"Israeli occupation forces crush with force Palestinian protest against settlement plan in West Bank""",9/1/20 16:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119065,"
TULKARM, Tuesday, September 1, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today crushed with force a peaceful Palestinian protest against land grab in order to build an illegal industrial settlement affecting several northern West Bank villages, reported WAFA correspondent.
She said that the soldiers attacked the protesters firing teargas at them and beating them up in an effort to crush their protest at a road that links the three villages of Jabara, al-Ras, and Shoufa, south and east of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm, where Israel plans to build an illegal industrial settlement.
The Israeli occupation forces attacked participants in the protest organized by local nationalist forces and the Wall and Settlements Resistance Commission. Journalists covering the event were also attacked and prevented from filming it, said WAFA correspondent.
The army set up checkpoints on roads leading to the protest area and stopped activists attempting to reach it and prevented them from continuing on the road.
Tulkarm Governor Issam Abu Bakr, who participated in the protest, said this activity will continue until this settlement project, which is a threat to Tulkarm because it separates it from nearby Qalqilya governorate and other towns, is stopped.
Head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, Walid Assaf, who also took part in the protest, warned that this project, if allowed, will restrict the movement of people in the area, not to mention its impact on the environment.
He said the protest activities will continue in order to defeat this project and other illegal Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.

BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, September 01, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today seized a large quantity of construction material from Tuqu town, southeast of Bethlehem, in order to prevent a local Palestinian from proceeding with building his house, said a local municipal source.
Director of Tuqu municipality, Tayseer Abu Mefreh said that a large Israeli military force escorted two forklifts into the western part of the town, known as al-Halqum, where they seized 15 bundles of brick and 15 others of building stone intended for the construction of a house purportedly for being built without a license.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military control, as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies building permits for Palestinians in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the area of the occupied West Bank, forcing residents to build without a permit to provide shelter for their families.
In contrast, Israel builds thousands of housing units in illegal settlements to Jewish settlers and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

The Israeli municipality ordered the demolition of the two houses, each 65 square meters in area and house nine people, under the pretext that they were built without a permit.
Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem say they are forced to build without permit because the Israeli municipality rarely issues permits to the city’s Palestinian citizens as a way to reduce their number by forcing them to leave it and find accommodation and work elsewhere while building thousands of housing units in illegal settlements for its Jewish population.

RAMALLAH, Monday, August 31, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian administrative detainee in Israel ended today a 23-day hunger strike after getting Israel to end his administrative detention and solitary confinement, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Commission.
It said Mohammad Wahdan, from the village of Rantis, near Ramallah, ended the hunger strike he started 23 days ago to protest his administrative detention without charge or trial after Israel agreed to release him on $1500 bail following changing his detention status from administrative into a case.
Another detainee, Mousa Zahran, 53, from Deir Abu Mishaal, near Ramallah, also ended yesterday a 12-day hunger strike after he was promised to end his administrative detention.

HEBRON, Monday, August 31, 2020 (WAFA) – Several sheep were killed yesterday when an Israeli settler rammed his car into a herd of sheep owned by a Palestinian farmer in Masafer Yatta in the south of the occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Coordinator of the Popular and National Committees in Yatta and Southern Hebron, Rateb al-Jabour, told WAFA that an Israeli settler deliberately rammed into the herd composed of 50 sheep owned by Ayed al-Shawaheen near the illegal Israeli settlement of Maon killing some and injuring others.
Masafer Yatta residents, who are mainly Bedouins, make a living of raising livestock, mainly sheep, and they often roam the open pastures in that area to feed their herd. Israeli settlers and army often pursue the shepherds and force them to leave the pastures or confiscate their herd.
Shawaheen’s losses are estimated the thousands of dollars.

JERUSALEM, Sunday, August 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Thousands of Israeli settlers demonstrated last night in occupied Jerusalem demanding incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. The protests were the latest in a months-long weekend rallies demanding his resignation over corruption charges and mishandling the coronavirus outbreak.
Thousands of protesters took part in the main demonstration outside Netanyahu's residence in occupied Jerusalem demanding him to step down. Photos circulated on social media showed several protesters being dragged by Israeli police near Netanyahu's residence. 
Protests also erupted in other areas in Israel, including at junctions and overpasses and outside Netanyahu's private house in the seafront town of Caesarea.
At the main rally in Jerusalem, protesters gathered at the entrance of the city and marched to Netanyahu's official residence, holding Israeli flags and black flags symbolizing one of the protest movements.
Some of the placards waved by the protesters read: ""Enough with Division!"" and ""This is not politics, this is crime"".
Last year Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. Many protesters say he should not serve as a prime minister at a time when he is on trial for serious charges.

GAZA, Sunday, August 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation’s artillery bombed two sites in the Gaza Strip early today morning, causing financial damages to property but no casualties, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that the Israeli artillery, stationed near the Israeli perimeter fence northeast of the city of Khan Younis, south of the Strip, fired a few missiles at a site to the east of the city, destroying it and causing damages to nearby facilities but no human injuries.
Israeli artillery also fired two more missiles at a site to the east of the city of Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Gaza Strip, causing damages to property. No human casualties were reported, however.
Today’s Israeli attacks are the latest in a series of aerial and artillery strikes by the Israeli occupation against the coastal enclave for the third week.
The Israeli occupation’s military has claimed that the strikes are in response to the flying of incendiary kites by Palestinian civilians into the Israeli military outposts and settlements surrounding the Gaza Strip. However, Palestinians have been defending the practice as a form of expressing resentment over the tightened Israeli blockade which has stifled all aspects of life in the enclave for 14 years.

QALQILIA, Friday, August 28, 2020 (WAFA) – At least one Palestinian was injured by Israeli occupation forces today as the forces attacked the weekly protest against Israeli settlements, which takes place every Friday in the village of Kafr Qaddum in the northern West Bank, local sources said.
Morad Shtewi, an official in charge of the popular resistance file in the village, told WAFA that Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated rounds and teargas at the protesters, injuring one of them by rubber-coated rounds. Others also sustained suffocation from gas inhalation.
The injured was treated at the scene by local medics.
For many years, villagers from Kafr Qaddum and neighboring villages have been protesting every Friday against illegal Israeli settlements, as well as to call on Israeli authorities to reopen the village’s main road, which has been sealed off by the occupation authorities since 2002.
Shtewi said another Palestinian young man was injured when an explosive device, which was recently planted by the occupation forces in the village, detonated during today's protest.

NABLUS, Friday, August 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Extremist Israeli settlers last night torched a vehicle and sprayed racist graffiti on walls after sneaking into the village of Asira al-Qibiliya, to the south of Nablus city in the occupied West Bank, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settler-related violence in the district, told WAFA that a group of hardline Israeli settlers sneaked into the village in middle of the night, torched a vehicle owned by Abdul-Qader Asayrah, a local citizen, and sprayed hate and racists slogans calling for the ethnic cleansing of Arabs on walls.
Earlier this month, Daghlas said there has been a surge in settlers' attacks against Palestinian civilians and property in the Nablus area, and in their efforts to grab as much Palestinian land as possible to expand their settlements including the recent setting up of mobile homes on Palestinian-owned land.
Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities. It includes arsons of property and mosques, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.

Khalil’s brother, Khaled Dweikat, told WAFA correspondent that the soldiers raided his brother’s house and interrogated his family before taking measurements of the two-story house where Khalil, his wife and six children live – a process that often leads to the demolition of the house as a part of Israel’s collective punishment policy against the Palestinian people under its occupation.

"Activist says Israeli military planted explosives in a West Bank village with an intention to hurt civilians""",8/26/20 19:28,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/119006,"
QALQILYA, Wednesday. August 26, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian activist today accused the Israeli military of planting explosives in the village of Kufr Qaddoum in the north of the West Bank with the intention of hurting civilians.
Murad Shteiwi, coordinator of Popular Resistance in Kufr Qaddoum, said Israeli occupation soldiers planted three explosive devices in boxes in the village after they had stormed the eastern area of the village near a water reservoir and a public park on Tuesday and Wednesday and that the devices were discovered on Thursday.
He said one of the boxes exploded and slightly wounded a village resident in his 30s in his hand and eye, while the second box was detonated after stones were thrown at it and its explosion was stronger than the first.
The occupation army then returned to the village detonated the third bomb apparently to hide its actions.
Shteiwi said that on Tuesday of the same week, some of the children in the village noticed cardboards with Hebrew inscriptions warning anyone who approaches that area of death or being blown up.
He pointed out that a group of women, accompanied by children, were wandering in that area before one of them discovered the explosives in orange boxes and covered with pieces of cloth usually used by the occupation army as a camouflage.
He said that after the occupation army has failed in suppressing the village’s weekly protests for the past nine years, it has resorted to this deadly method in order to deter the people and stop the popular resistance, pointing to what was published by the Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz, in which soldiers from the Nahal unit admitted to planting these devices to deter citizens.

He told WAFA that owners of the three houses, one of them two stories and the other two one floor, were given demolition orders by the Israeli military.
Two other residents were informed that the military is going to demolish retaining walls in their land.
Five other residents of the village were also ordered to stop work on the construction of their houses.
The Israeli occupation authorities seek to seize Nahalin village land for its illegal settlement activities in that area.

"Israel forces two brothers to demolish their houses south of Jerusalem""",8/26/20 12:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118997,"
 
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, August 26, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli authorities Wednesday morning forced two Palestinian brothers to demolish their own houses in Sur Baher village, southeast of Jerusalem, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said Mohammad Dabash, and his brother, Bilal, overnight embarked on tearing down their houses, each of which occupying an area of 280 meters square, in order to avoid paying a fine of between ILS 100,000 and 200,000 (USD 29,000 – 59,000) should the Israeli municipality carries out the demolition itself. 
He added that an Israeli court issued the demolition order on July 27, and the Dabash brothers were allowed a month to implement it.
The demolition displaced Mohammad and Bilal’s families, comprising 11 members, including seven children.
The structures were demolished purportedly for lacking the rarely-granted construction licenses.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Israeli warplanes strike Gaza""",8/26/20 09:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118995,"
 
GAZA, Wednesday, August 26, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes Wednesday early morning struck a site to the east of Khan Younis city in the southern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that an Israeli reconnaissance plane fired two rockets toward a plot of agricultural land, situated to the east of Khuza‘a town, east of Khan Younis, before the site was targeted once again with three missiles fired by an Israeli warplane, causing extensive destruction to the site and damages to the nearby houses, but no injuries.
The latest attacks follow over two week of heightened tensions, during which Israel closed the Karem Abu Salem goods crossing with the strip, shut down the coastal fishing zone, and halted the supply of fuel, forcing Gaza’s sole power plant to stop operating. 
Israel claims the attacks and other punitive measures came in retaliation for the flying of incendiary balloons from Gaza into bordering Israeli sites.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Israel to demolish two houses in Bethlehem-district village""",8/25/20 16:27,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118991,"
BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, August 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today delivered orders to demolish two Palestinian houses in al-Maniya village, northeast of Bethlehem, according to a municipal source.
Head of al-Maniya village council, Zeyad Kawazba, told WAFA that Israeli forces stormed the village and handed military orders to demolish two houses purportedly for being built without rarely-issued Israeli licenses.
The houses, each occupying an area of some 200 square meters, belonging to Yousef Jabbarin, and his brother, Shadi, and are currently inhabited by their families.
On August 7, Israel ordered a halt on the construction of two inhabited houses in the same village.
Located some nine kilometers to the southeast of Bethlehem, al-Maniya has a population of some 1,450 and occupies a total area of 8,908 dunums, while almost 90 percent of its land is classified as C, which is under full Israeli control.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank.

"Israel demolishes makeshift structures in Ramallah-district community""",8/25/20 11:35,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118987,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, August 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Israel today demolished eight makeshift structures in the Bedouin community of Wadi al-Seeq, situated to the northeast of Ramallah district, according to local sources.
They said a large Israeli military occupation force escorted a bulldozer into the community, established on rented land belonging to the adjacent towns of Deir Dibwan, Rammun and Taybeh, where the heavy machine tore down the structures, displacing their occupants, and seizing their contents.
Owners of the demolished structures were identified as three members of the Ka‘abneh clan. 
As one of 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities at the risk of forcible transfer in the northeastern Ramallah district, Wadi al-Seeq is a home of some 150 people, 62 percent of whom are children, and their flock, as housed in approximately 100 makeshift structures.
They depend on the sale of their dairy products and wool in local markets for their livelihood. They are neither connected to water or electricity networks and rely on the costly delivery of water tanks (4x the cost of piped tariffs) and solar panels.
The community was expelled from their lands in the Naqab in 1948 to the Jordan Valley, becoming refugees, and eventually settled in Wadi al-Seeq, where they have resided in the West Bank prior to its occupation in 1967 or the designation of certain lands as “C” following the Oslo Accords, as confirmed by the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC).
“Yet, the community, as all Bedouin communities in the West Bank, has been continuously targeted by the State of Israel for its presence in key areas earmarked for effective annexation (i.e. the Jordan Valley and the Jerusalem periphery).” 
The community falls along the Alon settlement road (Road No. 458) connecting the colonial settlement blocs in the vicinity to each other; Kochav Hashachar, Rimonim and Ma’ale Michmash, on route to the Jordan Valley. Its vulnerability to forceful displacement is exacerbated by the footpaths frequented by Israeli hikers and violent settlers. 
It first received blanket demolition orders issued by the Israeli Civil Administration, the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank, in 1996 on alleged grounds that the vicinity was a “closed military training zone”. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled at the time that the communities’ structures (save for the three structures furthest East) do not pose a “threat” to the State of Israel and may continue to be situated in their vicinities.
The community received a new batch of demolition orders in October and November of 2018, and another batch in May of 2019, including a demolition order against the community’s sole elementary school, built with European Union donor funding, a step that prompted the EU to deplore the continuing threat of demolitions and seizures of Palestinian structures.
The community received a third batch of demolition orders in May 2020, with 34 new orders against housing and livelihood structures.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories. 
While Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"House demolitions in occupied Jerusalem continue at full force""",8/25/20 09:19,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118982,"
RAMALLAH, Tuesday, August 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian-owned houses were demolished this morning and last night in occupied East Jerusalem under the pretext of construction without a permit, according to various sources.
In Silwan neighborhood, south of Jerusalem, staff from the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem demolished a house owned by Khaled al-Khales, said witnesses.
Israeli occupation forces cordoned off the area before the staff began to knock down the one-story house using manual tools because of its location inside a narrow closed-in area.
In Sur Baher, another East Jerusalem neighborhood, Mohammad Amira was forced last night to knock down his own house to avoid having to pay a heavy fine and costs if the West Jerusalem municipality would tear it down.
According to Khaled Abu Tayeh, a local activist, Amira, who first built his house in 1992, buried it under mounds of earth after the Israeli occupation municipality started to demolish Palestinian houses in that area to avoid its demolition.
Nevertheless, the municipality gave him 10 days to destroy it or it would do it itself and force him to pay all costs, forcing Amira to bring a bulldozer and tear it down with his own hands.
According to Palestinian officials, 18,000 Palestinian-owned houses in occupied East Jerusalem are under threat of demolition by the municipality for construction without a permit, while 650 demolition orders were issued this year alone.

"Thousands of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem are under threat of demolition, says official""",8/24/20 14:10,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118976,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, August 24, 2020 (WAFA) –  At least 18,000 Palestinian-owned houses in the occupied city of Jerusalem are under the threat of demolition by the Israeli occupation authorities, today said Abdullah Siam, the Palestinian Authority's Deputy Jerusalem Governor.
He told the official Voice of Palestine radio that the Israeli courts are currently considering demolition cases against these homes at a time there is a need for 15,000 housing units in the occupied city.
Siam noted that this comes as another example of Israel’s collective punishment and ethnic cleansing policy against Palestinians in Jerusalem in its plan to increase the number of Jewish settlers in the city through demolishing Palestinian houses and forcing them out of their city.
To be noted, the Israeli occupation authorities issued since the start of this year about 650 demolition orders against houses and structures owned by Palestinians in Jerusalem.

"Adalah takes new legal actions to compel Israel to protect health of East Jerusalem Palestinians""",8/24/20 13:37,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118975,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, August 24, 2020 (WAFA) - In response to a renewed COVID-19 outbreak in Jerusalem, which now appears to be more severe than the first wave, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel has taken a new series of legal actions to compel Israeli authorities to protect the health of Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.
In an alarming trend, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem comprise some 50 percent of the 4,000 verified new COVID-19 patients in the city, according to recent data from Israel’s Jerusalem Municipality.
Forty-one percent of East Jerusalem Palestinians recently tested for COVID-19 have been verified as infected; this is more than 11 times the national rate.
The Jerusalem Municipality reported on 13 August 2020 that the number of newly-verified infections in East Jerusalem during the preceding 24 hour-period reached 188.
Adalah took three urgent legal actions this past week in response to the renewed COVID-19 outbreak in East Jerusalem:

Lack of COVID-19 test centers for Palestinians beyond Jerusalem Separation Wall

The COVID-19 testing centers that were opened in Shuafat refugee camp and Kufr Aqab during the first wave of the outbreak, following Adalah's Israeli Supreme Court petition, were shut down after several weeks and never reopened. But there are now more than 300 verified COVID-19 patients in these two neighborhoods alone, according to data from the Jerusalem Municipality. Adalah sent an urgent letter to the director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry on 16 August 2020 demanding that it reopen COVID-19 test sites for Palestinians living in these neighborhoods.

Irregular water supply endangers health of Jerusalem’s Palestinians

Due to poor infrastructure and limits on the quantities of water sold from Israel’s Mekorot national water carrier, the Ramallah-Al Quds company has been supplying water to Palestinian residents of Kufr Aqab and the surrounding East Jerusalem neighborhoods. This company, which has operated in these areas even prior to the 1967 Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, can only supply water to these areas three days a week. The 70,000 Palestinian residents living in these neighborhoods are therefore forced to store water under unsupervised conditions which do not allow the implementation of standards recommended by the World Health Organization guidelines for combating the spread of COVID-19. Adalah sent a letter to Israeli authorities on 16 August 2020 calling on them to ensure a regular supply of water to the residents of Kufr Aqab and surrounding neighborhoods, as mandated by law.

Israel resumes demolitions of Palestinian homes halted during pandemic’s first wave

Adalah sent an urgent letter on 17 August 2020 demanding Israel freeze its home demolition policy after recent weeks have seen an acceleration in demolitions of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem. Israel had temporarily suspended demolitions during the first wave of COVID-19 but, according to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Territories (OCHA), Israel demolished 31 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem in July and August 2020 alone – leaving about 96 people homeless. With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, Israeli authorities had modified their planning and construction “enforcement policy” during the new state of emergency, suspending most demolitions of residential buildings and reducing friction with the Palestinian population. However, Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes have now been aggressively renewed despite a significantly more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic threatening the residents of East Jerusalem.

He said that a warplane fired three missiles at a site northeast of Khan Younis causing a deep hole in the ground. No human casualties were reported, however.
Meanwhile, Israeli artillery fired a number of shells at a site to the east of Rafah, destroying it and setting it on fire without causing human injuries.
Intermittent Israeli areal, land and sea attacks on the impoverished and devastated Gaza Strip have continued for the second week in a row under the pretext of retaliation to rocket and incendiary balloon attacks from Gaza into Israel.
Israel has also tightened the 13-year long blockade on Gaza by banning entry of all sorts of goods, mainly fuel, disrupting daily life.

"Israeli municipality demolishes structures near Jerusalem""",8/23/20 12:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118962,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, August 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today demolished several structures including shacks in the occupied Jerusalem neighborhood of al-Issawiya, local sources said.
Israeli municipality crews accompanied by police and bulldozers broke into the neighborhood and proceeded to demolish the structures and shacks, owned by local Palestinian citizen Mohammad Abd Muheisen, under the pretext that he had built them without an Israeli permit.
Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem have no option but to build without a permit because the Israeli municipality rarely issues permits to the city’s original Palestinian citizens as a way to reduce their number by forcing them to leave it and find accommodation and work elsewhere.
Although Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem live in an area classified as an internationally recognized Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

Hasan Burajiya, director of the office of the Apartheid Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission in Bethlehem, told WAFA that the occupation forces ordered the demolition of the two buildings, each consisting of two floors of 200 square meters, under the pretext that they are too close to the Israeli segregation barrier.
Last year, the occupation authorities demolished over a hundred apartments in the area under the same pretext, leaving their Palestinian residents homeless.
The demolitions were condemned by the international community at that time, including the EU which said that the majority of the demolished structures, unlike others Israel has demolished in eastern Jerusalem, are located in Area A and B of the West Bank, “where, according to the Oslo Accords, all civil issues are under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority.”

In Masafer Yatta, settlers from the illegal Maon settlement attacked shepherds as they were grazing their sheep in the open fields and forced them to take their sheep and leave the area, according to Fouad al-Imour, a local activist.
He said that in another incident, settlers from the illegal Mitpze Yair and Susyia settlements, built on expropriated Palestinian land in Masafer Yatta, cut hundreds of olive trees in the area.
In the north of the West Bank, settlers set up a mobile home on Palestinian land in the town of Beita, near the illegal settlement named 777, which is often the first step in taking over the land and placing more housing units on it, according to Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the north of the West Bank.

"Despite heavy costs, Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem decide not to self-demolish their homes""",8/22/20 12:53,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118951,"
JERUSALEM, Saturday, August 22, 2020 (WAFA) –Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem have decided not to tear down their homes with their own hands in defiance of demolition orders issued by the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem under the pretext of construction without permit and to leave this job to the Israelis, despite the heavy costs.
In a public meeting for Palestinian residents of Silwan neighborhood held last week and reconfirmed yesterday with a public prayer held at a solidarity tent in the area, the residents decided to stop yielding to pressure from the Israeli municipality, whom they accuse of discriminating against the non-Jewish residents of the city, and demolish their own homes under the threat that they will be heavily fined and forced to pay exorbitant costs if the municipality carries out the demolition.
The families of Silwan held a meeting to discuss “the rabid and systematic offensive by the occupation municipality to displace and break the men's resolve with the policy of house demolition and fining their owners before and after the demolition through intimidation and submission to the decisions of the occupation municipality to divide our dear town and legalize their laws, which are not binding to us,” said the Silwan families in a statement after their meeting.
“Demolishing houses with their bulldozers or self-demolition has become one of the weapons they use to fight us,” they added, calling on people not to self-demolish their homes and to stand by those who have their homes demolished and help them remain steadfast in their city.
As a result of this decision, more and more Palestinian families in the occupied city have decided against destroying their homes and the latest was the Abdo family from Jabal al-Mukabber.
Reports said today that the family has decided not to tear down its home by itself after receiving a demolition order from the Israeli municipality under the pretext its house was built without a permit.
“The demolition of houses is a crime that our family cannot commit against itself, and if the occupiers insist on doing it, then let them do it and let them be exposed to the whole world so that they will not have the satisfaction that the demolition is done by the residents,” said the Abdo family, which explained that the demolition order against its house was issued in March but that it only knew about it when the order was posted on its door in July stating that the house will be demolished in 21 days.
But not all families seem able to defy the municipality and its long punishing arm.
Reports today said that Ghaleb Abbasi, from Silwan, tore down the foundation for a house he was building after he got a threatening demolition order from the municipality.
According to Khaled Abu Tayeh, member of Silwan Land Defense Committee, Abbasi had built the 160-square-meter foundation eight years ago in the hope to get a permit to continue construction of his house. But instead he received a demolition order and forced to tear it apart to avoid paying high fees and costs.
Israel issued 650 demolition orders against Palestinian homes and structures in East Jerusalem this year.
Palestinians in the city say they are forced to build without permit because getting one is almost impossible from a racist municipality that is ready to build thousands of housing units for Jews and not a single house for the Palestinians.

"Israeli attacks on the besieged Gaza Strip continue for the second week from the land and sea""",8/22/20 10:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118950,"
GAZA, Saturday, August 22, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli artillery shelled locations in the besieged Gaza Strip and its navy opened fire at fishermen’s boats in the northern Gaza coast, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said two shells were fired at a location east of the town of Khuzaa, east of Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, destroying the site and causing fire but no human casualties.
Three shells were also fired at a location east of Rafah city, also in the south of the Strip, destroying it in total.
Meanwhile, Israeli navy opened fire at Palestinian fishing boats while they were at the pier in the north of the Gaza Strip, damaging some, said WAFA correspondent.
Israel has tightened last week its 13-year-old blockade on Gaza by totally closing the fishing area therefore denying thousands of Gazans a chance to make a daily living, closing the only commercial land crossing between Israel and Gaza thus preventing entry of badly needed supplies including fuel, which led the power generators supplying parts of Gaza with electricity to stop operating and affecting work at Gaza hospitals.
It claimed the bombardment of Gaza and the collective punishment were in retaliation for the flying of incendiary balloons from Gaza into southern Israeli fields that caused fire.

RAMALLAH, Friday, August 21, 2020 (WAFA) – At least two Palestinians were injured and many others suffocated from teargas today, as Israeli occupation forces attacked several protests against Israeli settlements and against the UAE-Israel normalization deal, which set off in many areas across the occupied West Bank.
In Qalqilia district, the occupation forces attacked dozens of protesters taking part in the weekly anti-settlements protest in the village of Kafr Qaddum, injuring two protesters by rubber-coated rounds and many others by teargas.
In Salfit district, Israeli soldiers attacked protesters who were demonstrating against Israel’s plan to confiscate large swathes of Palestinian-owned land in the village. Some of the protesters were beaten and injured by the soldiers. The protesters held the weekly Friday prayer on the land threatened with confiscation.
In Hebron, south of the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians performed the Friday prayer on a land threatened with Israeli confiscation in Masafer Yatta area. The protest and prayer were attacked by Israeli soldiers and settlers, but no injuries were reported.
A similar protest also took place in the village of Ni’lin, west of Ramallah, where several cases of inhalation from teargas were reported.

"Settlers storm Bethlehem-district village""",8/21/20 10:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118940,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Friday, August 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers Friday morning stormed al-Walaja village, located to the northwest of Bethlehem city, according to a local activist.
Ibrahim Awadallah said that groups of Israeli settlers, under military protection, barged their way into the village, and toured the Rweisat Mount and a local water spring, known as al-Hadafa.
He added that the mount and the water spring are at the risk of seizure as Israeli forces posted a military order to expropriate the water spring five years ago.
Located at a horizontal distance of 5 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem, al-Walaja has a population of some 2,800 and occupies a total area of 4,328 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given ed control over a small pocket of land occupying 113 dunams and accounting for only 2.6 percent of the village’s total area. This area is classified as Area B. In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
An area of 4,209 dunams of the village, accounting for 97 percent, is completely isolated by the section of Israel’s apartheid wall. The majority of this land is agricultural land, forests and open spaces.
The village is flanked by two Israeli colonial settlements; Gilo from the east and Har Gilo from the south.
Israel uses the Jewish nationalist name “Judea and Samaria” to refer to the occupied West Bank to reinforce its bogus claims to the territory and to give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Israel’s nation-state law that passed last July stated that building and strengthening the settlements is a “national interest.”

"Israel bombs Gaza for eighth day in a row""",8/21/20 09:49,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118938,"
 
GAZA, Friday, August 21, 2020 (WAFA) – For the eighth day in a row, Israeli warplanes early Friday morning bombed several sites across the besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli warplane fired three missiles at a site to the west of Gaza city, causing heavy destruction to the site and the neighboring houses and causing fires to break out.
The warplanes also targeted a site to the northwest of Beit Lahia town in the northern coastal enclave with two missiles, causing major damage to the site as well as to nearby property.
Meanwhile, Israeli used the artillery against farmlands to the east of Gaza city.
Late Thursday, Israeli combat helicopters targeted a site to the west of Khan Younes city in the southern enclave with at least six missiles.
The airstrikes and artillery shelling resulted in material damage. No human casualties were reported though.
The latest attacks follows eight days of heightened tensions, during which Israel closed the Karem Abu Salem goods crossing with the strip, shut down the coastal fishing zone, and halted the supply of fuel, forcing Gaza’s sole power plant to stop operating.
Israel claims the attacks and other punitive measures came in retaliation for the flying of incendiary balloons from Gaza into bordering Israeli sites.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

RAMALLAH, Thursday, August 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today afternoon sealed off the main entrances of Nabi Saleh and Aboud villages, northwest of Ramallah city, according to local sources.
The sources confirmed that Israeli forces closed the iron gates at the entrances of the two villages, preventing access to and exit from the villages and forcing passengers to take lengthy alternative detours.
The entrance of Nabi Saleh serves as the main access point to the cluster of Bani Zeid al-Gharbia villages as well as to some of Salfit-district villages.
The closure came in the wake of the killing of a teen in the nearby village of Deir Abu Mashal.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.
Closures besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, August 19, 2020 (WAFA) –Israeli bulldozers today demolished a wall and issued demolition orders against a water pond and a barn in two different villages in the Jerusalem area, according to local sources.
An under-construction wall was demolished in the town of Hizma, northeast of occupied Jerusalem, according to Bashar Abu Khalil, owner of the property.
He told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces accompanied a bulldozer to the village and demolished a wall built around his two-dunum plot of land since 2017 under the pretext that it was built without a permit.
Meanwhile, Walid Azzam, an activist in the village of al-Judeira, northwest of Jerusalem, said the Israeli occupation authorities ordered the demolition of a pond, an animal barn and a wall owned by local families under the pretext they did not have a permit to build them.

She said that Israeli troops deployed along the area between Khirbet Jabara and Shufa villages showered with teargas peaceful protestors marching against Israel’s illegal move to level a large swath of their land for the construction of a bypass road for Israeli settlers, causing an unidentified number of suffocation cases, some were taken to hospital for treatment.
The soldiers prevented the protestors from approaching the area as bulldozers were leveling the land, known to the villagers as Jabal al-Wastani (the Middle Mount), to make room for the construction of a colonial settlement industrial zone.
They forced news reporters to leave the area at gunpoint, citing the declaration of the area as a closed military zone as a pretext.

Sources said the Gaza power plant was completely shut down today after fuel needed to run the electricity plant ran out in the aftermath of Israel’s closure of Karem Abu Salem crossing last Wednesday.
The Gaza Energy Authority estimates that the electricity deficit will increase to 75% without a functioning Gaza power station, plunging the electricity supply to Gazans to as low as three to four hours a day.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, August 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Tuesday morning demolished a residential building in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukabber, according to WAFA correspondent.
He reported that Israeli police escorted three bulldozers into al-Sal‘a area in the neighborhood, and cordoned off a 4-storey building under construction, before the heavy machines razed it.
Owner of the demolished building was identified as Aziz Ja‘abis.
The demolition raid sparked confrontations, during which police opened fire towards local youths who attempted to stop the demolition. No injuries were reported though.
The structure was demolished purportedly for lacking the rarely-granted construction license.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Israel launches airstrikes on Gaza""",8/18/20 09:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118909,"
 
GAZA, Tuesday, August 18, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli attack helicopters dawn Tuesday bombed several sites to the east of Rafah city in the southern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said that Israeli helicopters conducted a raid on a plot of agricultural land, located near the non-operational Gaza Airport, to the east of Rafah, causing material damage.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces opened fire towards a site to the north of Beit Lahia town, while the Israeli navy fired a few missiles into the sea offshore the northern besieged enclave.
The airstrikes and shelling resulted in material damage. No human casualties were reported though.
The latest attacks follow a week of heightened tensions, during which Israel closed the Karem Abu Salem goods crossing with the strip, shut down the coastal fishing zone, and halted the supply of fuel, forcing Gaza’s sole power plant to stop operating. 
Israel claims the attacks and other punitive measures came in retaliation for the flying of incendiary balloons from Gaza into bordering Israeli sites.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

They told WAFA that the arsonists sneaked into the neighborhood in the early morning hours, set fire to 13 vehicles and wrote anti-Palestinian racist graffiti on walls.
“Price tag” refers to an underground anti-Palestinian Israeli terror group that routinely attacks Palestinians in the occupied territories and inside Israel.
The Israeli government still refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and considers it only as a group of vandals.

The army closed the checkpoint and evacuated the injured Palestinian to a hospital in Jerusalem before reopening it for traffic.
Israeli police said in a statement that security guards at the checkpoint saw a man walking through the car lane and when they called on him to stop he kept on walking before shooting him in the leg after suspecting he had a knife. It turned out that the man was deaf and mute and that he was not in possession of a knife, said the police.
Several Palestinians were shot and killed or injured at Israeli checkpoints in Jerusalem and the West Bank before any attempt to verify if they were armed or not. Israelis are allowed to shoot and kill a Palestinian even at the least suspicion of an attack.

The governor was summoned earlier today for interrogation at al-Maskobiyya interrogation center, in Jerusalem.
Ghaith was banned four times from entering the West Bank, the last of which would have ended on the twentieth of this month. He has been arrested 17 times since he was named by the PA as governor of occupied Jerusalem two years ago.
Israel exerts all efforts, including detentions, expulsions, closure of institutions, ban on activities, to prevent any Palestinian activity in the occupied city that would undermine its illegal control over East Jerusalem, occupied since June 1967, and which the Palestinians insist is going to be the capital of their future state.

"Gaza power plant to stop operating next week due to lack of fuel""",8/16/20 18:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118889,"
RAMALLAH, Sunday, August 16, 2020 (WAFA) - Chairman of the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources. Authority, Zafer Melhem, said that the Gaza Strip’s only power plant will stop operating at its full production capacity by next Tuesday.
Melhem told WAFA the power plant will stop operating due to lack of fuel as a result of the Israeli occupation’s closure of Karm Abu Salem crossing, the only commercial border crossing between Israel and Gaza located to the southeast of Rafah, preventing the entry of industrial fuel intended to run Gaza’s only power plant since last Wednesday.
He said that this caused an increase in power supply deficit, to become more than 75%. 
Melhem stressed that the station's shutdown would negatively affect all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip, holding the Israeli occupation fully responsible for all the ensuing disastrous consequences.

Israeli navy fired a barrage of gunfire early today morning at groups of fishermen sailing about 1.5 miles off the Gaza Strip, and forced them to leave to the shore. The fishermen were told by the Israeli navy that they were no longer able to sail until further notice.
Earlier last night, warplanes bombed with six missiles a location near the city of Khan Younis, in the south of the Strip, causing damages but no casualties.
Israeli fighter jets also bombed multiple targets and an agricultural land across the coastal enclave, also causing damages but no casualties.
For four days now, Israeli occupation authorities have escalated their aggression against Gaza, bombing targets and firing at fishermen and farmers at times.

Naser Jawabreh, in charge of the Ministry of Information office in Nablus, told WAFA that settlers, protected by an army escort, broke into an agricultural area in the vicinity of the village, before they embarked on uprooting the olive saplings that have been planted by Palestinian activists in the area, which is facing an Israeli threat of confiscation.
He said that settlers yesterday attempted to set up tents in the same area, but were confronted by local citizens who forced them to leave the area.
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property is commonplace in the occupied West Bank, and is rarely prosecuted by the occupation authorities.
There are more than 450 thousand Jewish settlers living in the occupied Palestinian Territory in violation of international law.

GAZA, Saturday, August 15, 2020 (WAFA) – Two children aged three and 11 years and two women were injured in an Israeli bombardment of locations in the blockaded Gaza Strip early this morning, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said an Israeli warplane fired two missiles at an area east of Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip injuring a 3-year-old baby girl, an 11-year-old boy, and a woman, who were rushed to hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah. Serious damage was also caused to homes in the area of the attack.
Another woman was injured and homes damaged in a different air attack on a location in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip. The woman was also taken to hospital.
This the third day of Israeli aerial attacks and artillery shelling on the Gaza Strip, which, until this morning, have caused damage to property and no harm to residents other than causing panic among the population.
Israel has also imposed collective punishment on the besieged Gaza Strip and its two-million population by closing the only commercial crossing with Gaza, banning entry of badly needed fuel and cutting in half the fishing area Gaza fishermen are allowed to sail in to earn a living.
Israel claims the attacks and punishment were in retaliation for flying incendiary balloons from Gaza into bordering Israeli areas causing fire to fields.

GAZA, Friday, August 14, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli navy Friday opened gunfire towards Palestinian fishermen sailing offshore Beit Lahia town in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, injuring a fisherman, according to WAFA correspondent.
He said the Israeli navy fired rubber-coated steel bullets towards fishermen sailing within the designated fishing zone offshore the town, injuring a fisherman.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

He told WAFA that occupation soldiers escorted bulldozers into an area of the village where they leveled large tracts of lands and paved a 10 meter–long road for settlers leading to the illegal colonial settlement of Avni Hefetz.
He added that this land, which amounts to 600 dunums in area, has been a regular target of the settlers and Israeli army and any attempt by Palestinians to reclaim their land and plant it was fiercely attacked by the settlers and soldiers, who often sabotage the work and steal equipment used in the work.
Ghazaleh said the land in question is owned by village residents who have official documents proving ownership, explaining that building a road for settlers there would close main access to the village that connects it to Tulkarm city.

"Israeli settlers torch bulldozer, scrawl hate graffiti in northern West Bank village""",8/13/20 10:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118846,"
NABLUS, Thursday, August 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today torched a bulldozer and scrawled hate graffiti in Asira al-Qibliya village, southwest of Nablus city, according to a local official.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official who monitors settlements in the northern West Bank, said that some 20 Israeli settlers sneaked into the village during the night, set fire to a bulldozer and spray-painted hate graffiti threatening vandalism of Palestinian property.
He said the settlers, who came from Yitzhar, an illegal settlement inhabited by hardcore fanatic Jews, attacked a house situated on the outskirts of the village.
The villagers managed to fend off the settlers’ attack, prompting confrontations with Israeli occupation forces who provided protection to the settlers.
The soldiers fired a barrage of stun and tear gas grenades towards the villagers and their houses, causing several to suffocate.
Meanwhile, Israeli settlers slashed tires of three Palestinian vehicles in the Salfit-area village of Yasouf in the north of the West Bank after sneaking into the village during the night, according to local sources.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by the Israeli occupation authorities.

GAZA, Thursday, August 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked targets in the blockaded Gaza Strip early this morning while the fishing rights for Gazans were drastically reduced, reported WAFA correspondent.
He said a warplane fired two missiles at a site west of Gaza City in the north of the Gaza Strip, causing heavy damage to the site and neighboring buildings but no bodily harm.
Another fighter jet fired two missiles at agricultural land east of Beit Hanoun, also in the north, causing a deep hole in the ground, and two other missiles at a location east of Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip causing damage to property.
Israeli artillery also shelled a location east of Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip causing heavy damage to the location and nearby property.
At the same time, the Israeli occupation authorities reduced the fishing area for Gaza fishermen and stopped the entry of fuel into Gaza as part of its collective punishment policy against the Gaza Strip and its two million impoverished population.
Israel claims the attacks and collective punishment came following the firing of incendiary balloons from Gaza into bordering Israeli areas that caused fire but not bodily harm.

"Israeli bulldozers raze large tracts of land near Salfit""",8/12/20 15:05,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118836,"
 
Wednesday, August 12, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers today razed large tracts of Palestinian-owned land in Iskaka and Yasuf villages, located to the east of the West Bank city of Salfit, according to a local source. 
Head of Iskaka Village Council Fawzi Lami said that Israeli forces escorted bulldozers to the eastern area of the village, known as Khallet Ghanayem, where the heavy machines leveled the land to make room for the expansion of the nearby colonial settlement outpost of Nofei Nehemia, built on land confiscated from the village. 
Located some five kilometers to the east of Salfit city, Iskaka has a population of some 1,280 and occupies a total area of 5,476 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a pocket of land occupying 1,366 dunams, accounting for almost 25 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over the remainder 4,110 dunams, classified as Area C, accounting for 75 percent. 
Israel has seized at least 181 dunams of the village land for the establishment of Ariel colonial settlement, west of the village, in addition to more tracts of land from the south of the village to construct a settler-only road that connects Ariel and Rechelim colonial settlements.
The Nofei Nehemia outpost lies adjacent to the Rechalim colonial settlement, and is located within its boundaries. It together with the nearby colonial settlements of Rechalim, Kfar Taphuh, Eli, Shilo and Migdalim and 23 other Israeli outposts in the area form a bloc of settlements and outposts that act like a territorial contiguity between Ariel settlement bloc in the west and the Jordan Valley area in the east. Such a bloc will cut off the territorial contiguity of the Palestinian communities surrounding them and eventually annex the land available to Palestinians to expand in the future.

"Israel razes plot of land, force Palestinian to demolish his house in Jerusalem """,8/12/20 14:17,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118835,"
 
JERUSALEM, Wednesday, August 12, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli police today razed a plot of land and ordered a Palestinian to demolish his own house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukaber, said local  sources.
They said that Israeli police and crews of the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem escorted  a bulldozer into an area in the neighborhood, where they razed a plot of land. 
Meanwhile, Aziz Ellian embarked on tearing down a 100-meter-square extension to his house in the same neighborhood to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition itself.
He pointed out that despite attempting to obtain a building license, the Israeli municipality did not grant him the license and instead fined him with NIS 22,000 (some USD 6,500) for lacking the construction license.
Wadi Hilweh Information Center, a Silwan-based media center, posted a video for the land razing as well as another showing Ellian demolishing the extension of his house using a small bulldozer. 
This came as Israeli police demolished a wall under construction to the east of Qanaldiya, north of Jerusalem. 
All the structures were demolished purportedly for lacking the rarely-granted construction licenses.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.

"Israeli settlers fence off large swaths of land in  Jordan Valley""",8/12/20 11:48,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118832,"
 
JORDAN VALLEY, Wednesday, August 12, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers fenced off large swaths of Palestinian-owned grazing land in the northern Jordan Valley, according to local sources.
Aref Daraghmeh, an activist, told WAFA that a group of settlers had been fencing off large tracts of pastures in al-Mzuqah and al-Suwaidya areas since last week and up until yesterday.
Thousands of dunams of these pastures have been fenced off since the beginning of this year, with most of the area inaccessible to Palestinians as a result of being declared as “state land” and “natural reserves”.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

The settlers came from Yitzhar, an illegal settlement inhabited by hardcore fanatic Jews.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

He said that the Israeli fighter jets bombed a site to the southwest of the Gaza city, and another in the city of Rafah in the southern coastal enclave.
Meanwhile, Israeli artillery opened fire on agricultural lands close to al-Bureij refugee camp and to the east of Rafah city.
Last night, Israeli attack helicopters pounded a site in the town of Beit Lahia in the northern coastal enclave.
The attacks resulted in material damages, but no human casualties were reported.
This came in retaliation for the launching of incendiary balloons from the strip towards nearby illegal Israeli settlement, setting lands and crops on fire.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

"Residential tents demolished, orders issued against barns in south of West Bank""",8/11/20 15:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118823,"
HEBRON/BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, August 11, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today tore down and seized tents, while demolition orders were issued against livestock barns in the south of the West Bank, according to local sources.
Israeli occupation forces tore down two residential tents in Masafer Yatta villages of al-Fakhit and Maghayer al-Abeed, according to Fouad al-Imour, a local activist.

"Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem displaced following Israeli-ordered demolitions""",8/11/20 13:18,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118818,"
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, August 11, 2020 (WAFA) – Three Palestinian brothers and their families found themselves today homeless after the Israeli municipality of West Jerusalem demolished their three-apartment building in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan under the pretext of construction without permit, according to WAFA correspondent.
At the same time, two other Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem were forced to tear down their homes on their own at orders from the Israeli municipality for construction without permit or otherwise be forced to pay high costs if the demolition was undertaken by the municipal staff.
In Silwan, Israeli police and staff of the West Jerusalem municipality escorted bulldozers into Wadi Qaddum area where they cordoned off the three-apartment building before the bulldozers proceeded to demolish it, displacing over 25 people.
Owners of the apartments were identified as Wael Tahhan along with his brothers, Ala and Nader.
A member of Tahhan family said that despite making several attempts to apply for the necessary license, the Israeli municipality did not grant them the license and instead fined them some $74,000 for building without a license.
Wadi Hilweh Information Center, a Silwan-based media center, posted a video for the demolition. 
Meanwhile, Ibrahim Sabia and Khaled Abu-Taa were forced to demolish their homes in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah purportedly for being built without license.
Abu-Taa pointed out that he received a demolition order after he built his house a year and a half ago. Although he managed to freeze the order throughout this period, an Israeli court issued a final demolition order in July, allowing him one month to carry out the demolition himself.
Using the pretext of illegal construction, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis in occupied East Jerusalem to restrict Palestinian expansion. At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.

"Israel extends BDS coordinator Mahmoud Nawajaa’s detention by 8 days""",8/10/20 10:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118807,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, August 10, 2020 (WAFA) – Ignoring Amnesty International’s call for his immediate and unconditional release, an Israeli military judge yesterday extended by eight days the detention of Palestinian human rights defender and BDS coordinator Mahmoud Nawajaa for continued interrogation, according to Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association.
Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, which is interrogating Nawajaa at the Al-Jalameh interrogation center near Haifa, has presented no charges or evidence against him to date, even during yesterday’s hearing, held at a military court near Jenin.
Since his arrest on 30 July from his home near Ramallah, in the occupied Palestinian territory, Nawajaa has not been allowed to exercise his right to see his lawyer, appointed by Addameer.
On 7 August, Amnesty International issued a statement that said:
“Israeli authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Palestinian human rights defender Mahmoud Nawajaa, 34, the General Coordinator of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT).... He has been detained solely for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and association and is therefore a prisoner of conscience.”
The Amnesty statement called for pressure on Israel to release Nawajaa, saying that Israel has interpreted the international community’s failure “to take concrete action” to pressure it “as a green light” to pursue its illegal policies, including the persecution of Palestinian human rights defenders.
An international campaign with the hashtag, #FreeMahmoud, has grown to include parliamentarians, trade unions, solidarity groups, and social movements in many countries.
Speaking for the BDS movement for Palestinian rights, Stephanie Adam said:
“This further extension of the illegal detention of Mahmoud by Israel’s military court system, which is notorious for its near 100% conviction rate of Palestinians, proves once more that only sustained international pressure, coupled with internal popular struggle, can help Palestinians achieve liberation from Israel’s apartheid and colonial system.
“Mahmoud’s detention is an attack on the entire non-violent global BDS movement. With the support of millions of people of conscience worldwide, we’ll continue growing our movement until all Palestinians can enjoy freedom, justice and equality.”
The BDS movement has called on human rights activists worldwide to increase pressure in their respective countries to secure Israel’s immediate release of Mahmoud Nawajaa.

"Israel demolishes a Palestinian-owned house in Bethlehem-district village""",8/10/20 10:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118805,"
BETHLEHEM, Monday, August 10, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli occupation forces today demolished a house in Beit Iskaria village, south of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, under the pretext it was built without a permit, said a local activist.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem, Hassan Breijieh, said the occupation forces and officers of the so-called Civil Administration, an arm of the military government, stormed the village and proceeded to demolish the house belonging to Numan Saed.
He said the demolition was part of Israel’s policy to limit the village’s urban expansion and seize its land to make room for the expansion of nearby Israeli colonial settlements, particularly since the demolished house is located in an area surrounded by illegal settlements.
Located nine kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Beit Iskaria, also known as Khirbet Beit Zakariya, has a population of some 150 and occupies a total area of 6,735 dunums.
Under the 1993 Oslo Accords, 100 percent of the village was classified as Area C, which falls under full Israeli control.
The village lies in the heart of the Israeli colonial settlement cluster, part of which comprises the Gush Etzion colonial settlement bloc. That’s why the villagers often suffer from the ongoing attacks and provocations by Israeli settlers, who attempt to seize their lands, uproot their trees and destroy their houses with the help of the Israeli military.
Israel has established six colonial settlements on land confiscated from the village, along with a military camp and settler-only by-pass roads.
It also constructed a section of the apartheid wall on village land, isolating 99 percent of the village for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

NABLUS, Sunday, August 09, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian citizen was injured early today morning after extremist Israeli settlers hurled his vehicle with stones while he was driving on the Nablus-Qalqilia road in the occupied West Bank, local sources said.
Ghassan Daghlas, a Palestinian Authority official who monitors settlement and settlers' activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal Israeli settlement of Yitzhar attacked citizens' vehicles with rocks on the road said near the village of Burin, injuring at least one driver.
The injured man was taken to the nearby Darwish Nazzal hospital, where his injury was described as moderate.
Settler violence is routine in the occupied West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by the occupation authorities. Almost all kinds of violence by Jewish settlers go unpunished except in very rare cases.

"Dalia, a mother of two children, departed this world after she was hit by an Israeli bullet""",8/8/20 11:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118788,"
By Thayer Abu Bakr
JENIN, Saturday, August 08, 2020 (WAFA) - “I am hit, Bassem. Take care of the children.” These were the last words that Dalia Smoudi, 23, yelled to her husband before she fell on the ground, bleeding after she was hit by a fatal Israeli bullet in the chest that penetrated the liver, pancreas and artery.
Friday at dawn, when Dalia, the mother, was preparing a feed for her child, a bullet surprised her. She did not know that her yelling to close the windows of her house for fear her 4-month-old baby, Iyas, and his brother, Siraj, who is a year-and-a-half, would inhale the toxic teargas fired by the Israeli occupation forces during confrontations that broke out in their neighborhood in the northern West Bank city of Jenin will be her last.
Dalia's father, Ahmad Istiti, himself a former prisoner who spent several intermittent years in the prisons of the Israeli occupation, told WAFA, with pain in his heart: ""I had Dalia while I was a prisoner in the occupation jails in 1996, and I named her Dalia (grapevines) as a reflection of my belonging and love for Palestine, its land and its grapes.""
He added, ""The cold-blooded murder of my daughter is not the first and it will not be the last. It is a systematic policy by the occupiers against our women, children and elderly people while they are in their homes without any real deterrent that would stop this tragedy that is repeated continuously.""
Dalia did not pose a threat to the occupiers when she was shot, he said, adding that, the unruliness of the soldiers was evident when they opened fire at the Red Crescent ambulance that came to save her life, hitting it with two bullets.
""Why was my niece murdered?"" wondered Dalia's uncle, Omar. ""She was martyred while holding her two children, trying to protect them from the bullets of the occupation forces and the teargas canisters they were madly shooting everywhere, as usual, without any consideration for anyone's life.""
Dalia's grieving mother, still under shock, had only to call on her daughter not to leave them. ""Don't go away, Dalia. Stay with us,"" she said as she wept by her side while getting ready to bury her.

"Dozens injured in as Israeli forces quell anti-annexation march""",8/7/20 19:04,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118784,"
 
QALQILIYA, Friday, August 7, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday afternoon quelled an anti-annexation march in Kafr Qaddum town, east of Qalqiliya city, injuring dozens of protestors, said a local activist.
Coordinator of the Local Popular Resistance Committee Murad Ishtiwi said that Israeli troops opened fire towards protestors marching against Israel’s illegal move to annex large swaths of the West Bank, hitting a 23-year-old protestor with a rubber-coated steel bullet in the foot and causing dozens others to suffocate from tear gas inhalation.
All the suffocation cases received treatment at the scene.
Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu has declared many times his willingness to annex the illegal colonial settlements besides to the Jordan Valley, a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, which is home of some 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30 percent of the West Bank.
The annexation move is based on the US-touted Mideast plan, dubbed deal of the century, which in fact endorses Israel’s longstanding policy of permanent occupation, colonialism and apartheid over the Palestinian people.
The annexation of Palestinian territory occupied in 1967 is illegal under international law, and it would put much of the occupied West Bank under Israeli sovereignty, leaving only a few small pockets of densely populated Palestinian bantustans.

RAMALLAH, Friday, August 7, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces Friday afternoon opened fire at Palestinians protesting against Israel’s move to seize their land for settlement construction in Turmus Ayya town, north of Ramallah.
Mayor of Turmus Ayya Said Taleb said that Israeli troops opened fired towards peaceful protestors marching against Israel’s illegal move to seize large swaths of their land to make room for the expansion of a colonial settlement, injuring five protestors with rubber-coated steel bullets in their feet and causing dozens to suffocate from tear gas.
He pointed out that Israeli forces seized 3500 dunams of the villagers’ farmland, known as the Eastern Plain, and set up several tents on them as a prelude for the construction of a colonial settlement outpost several months ago.
Meanwhile, the Health Ministry confirmed that a Palestinian was hit with tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops in his face. He was rushed to a hospital in Ramallah, where medics described his condition as stable.

"Israel orders halt on construction of two houses southeast of Bethlehem""",8/7/20 16:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118782,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Friday, August 7, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today ordered a halt on the construction of two inhabited houses in al-Maniya village, southeast of Bethlehem city, said a municipal source.
Head of al-Maniya Village Council Zeyad Kawazba told WAFA that Israeli forces stormed the village and delivered stop-construction military orders for two houses, each occupying an area of 150 meters squared.
The two houses belong to Assaf al-Froukh and his brother, Issa, and are inhabited by their families.
Located some nine kilometers to the southeast of Bethlehem, al-Maniya has a population of some 1,450 and occupies a total area of 8,908 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 906 dunams, accounting for 10.1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 8,002, classified as Area C, accounting for 89.9 percent. 
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.
The “Civil Administration” is the name Israel gives to the body administering its military occupation of the West Bank.
Soldiers in the oxymoronically named Civil Administration determine where Palestinians may live, where and when they may travel (including to other parts of the occupied territories like Gaza and East Jerusalem), whether they can build or expand homes on their own land, whether they own that land at all, whether an Israeli settler can takeover that land among others.

JENIN, Friday, August 7, 2020 (WAFA) – A Palestinian woman Friday afternoon succumbed to her wounds sustained from Israeli military gunfire in Jenin city.
The Health Ministry confirmed that Dalia Samoudi, 23, succumbed to her critical wounds sustained from Israeli military gunfire during a raid into the Jenin city neighborhood of al-Jaberiyyat.
According to the ministry statement, Samoudi was hit with a bullet that penetrated her liver, pancreas and aortic artery. She was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent several surgeries and admitted into the intensive care unit, where she was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.  
In the early morning hours of today, Israeli forces raided al-Jaberiyyat neighborhood, where they interrogated and threatened to re-arrest a former prisoner after breaking into his house.
The raid sparked confrontations during which Israeli troops opened fire towards local teens who attempted to block their passage.
Director of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) Mahmoud al-Sa‘di confirmed that a Samoudi was hit in the chest with a bullet fired by Israeli forces while in her house during the raid.
He added that the forces directly opened fire on an ambulance trying to reach and evacuate the casualty from her house, with two bullets penetrating the ambulance.

Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement construction in the northern West Bank, confirmed that Israeli settlers sealed off the main Huwara Road, preventing Palestinian traffic in both directions.
He cautioned against the escalation of settler attacks against the Palestinian people and property, particularly in the area extending between Ramallah and Nablus districts.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Israel has established several 'bypass roads’, enabling Israeli traffic to bypass areas of Route 60 that passed through Palestinian jurisdiction.
Israeli severely restricts Palestinians’ freedom of movement through a complex combination of approximately 100 fixed checkpoints, flying checkpoints, settler-only roads and various other physical obstructions.

"Israeli warplanes strike site in northern Gaza Strip""",8/7/20 11:33,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118778,"
 
GAZA, Friday, August 7, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli warplanes Friday overnight stroke a site to Beit Lahya town in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, according to WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that an Israeli fighter jet and an Israeli drone targeted a site north of the town, setting on it fire and causing properties damages.
No human casualties were reported, however.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.

JERICHO, Thursday, August 6, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation forces today destroyed irrigation ponds in al-Jiftlik village, located to the north of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, said a local municipal source.
Mayor of al-Jiftlik, Ahmad Abu Ghanem, said the Israeli occupation destroyed three ponds that were used to irrigate 70 dunums of village land, filling them with debris to discontinue their use.
Yesterday, Israeli forces uprooted and seized some 100 palm trees in the village. 
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to water in the area, particularly the 23 underground wells used for agriculture. Local water springs are susceptible to dryness and depletion as a result of Israel’s control over water. 
The Israeli water company, Mekorot, has depleted the wells and has been granted a monopoly on the drilling, restoration, distribution and selling of Palestinian water. In contrast, Palestinians have been forbidden from constructing new wells or restoring existing ones.

He added that the occupation soldiers and settlers attacked the Palestinians and kicked them out of the area where the local villagers plan to hold the Friday prayer tomorrow in an effort to prevent the establishment of a new colonial outpost on their lands.

NABLUS, Thursday, August 6, 2020 (WAFA) – Palestinians have warned today that an Israeli terror cell of settlers is targeting civilians between Ramallah and Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
Ghassan Daghlas, a Palestinian Authority official who monitors settlement and settlers’ activities in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that a terror cell of settlers was behind the recent attacks between Ramallah and Nablus, citing the burning of a mosque in al-Bireh, adjacent to Ramallah, the torching of vehicles in Jamaeen and Farata, south of Nablus, and the attacks against civilians in Taybeh and Duma after setting up roadblocks on the road between these two villages, as only few examples of the work of this terror cell.
He said this terror group was seen last night at the entrance to al-Lubban al-Sharqiya village on the Ramallah-Nablus road while other members of the group broke into an historical area north of Nablus.

TUBAS, Wednesday, August 05, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today rammed their military vehicle into a Palestinian in the northern West Bank city of Tubas, said a local source.
Director of the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS) Office in Tubas Kamal Bani-Odeh confirmed that Israeli forces rammed their military jeep into Mustafa Abu Siaj as they conducted a detention raid in the city, inflicting injuries across his body.
Abu Siaj was rushed to a hospital for urgent treatment. 
Israeli forces frequently raid Palestinian houses almost on a daily basis across the West Bank on the pretext of searching for ""wanted"" Palestinians, triggering clashes with residents.
These raids, which take place also in areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, are conducted with no need for a search warrant, whenever and wherever the military chooses in keeping with its sweeping arbitrary powers.
Raids besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.
The United Nations stated that: “Security operations conducted by the Israeli Security Forces in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, often result in deaths, live ammunition injuries, excessive tear gas exposure and home demolitions.”

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, August 05, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli bulldozers Wednesday morning demolished three houses and a commercial structure in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, said a local activist.
Member of the Committee for the Defense of Silwan Land Khaled Abu Tayeh confirmed that Israeli police and staff of the Israeli Jerusalem municipality escorted bulldozers into Ein al-Lowza area in Silwan, where the heavy machineries demolished two houses belonging to siblings Samer and Suleiman al-Qaq.
The demolition was carried out two days after al-Qaq siblings received military demolition orders and evacuated their belongings.
The bulldozers also demolished another house and a barbershop in the same area.
The house owner was identified as Sharif Amro and the owner of the barbershop was identified as Amr Shiha. 
All the demolitions were carried out under the pretext of unlicensed construction.
Meanwhile, Mohammad Alon was forced to tear down his own 90-meter-square house to avoid paying exorbitant costs if the Jerusalem municipality carries out the demolition itself, displacing his entire seven-member family. 
Wadi al-Hilweh Information Center, a Silwan-based monitor, said that the Israeli municipality issued last month an order to demolish Alon's house without giving him any opportunity to appeal or delay the decision, noting that he's been trying to get a permit for eight years, but instead was fined with NIS 30,000.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.
Although Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian Territory that has been subject to Israeli military occupation since 1967, they are denied their citizenship rights and are instead classified only as ""residents"" whose permits can be revoked if they move away from the city for more than a few years.
They are also discriminated against in all aspects of life including housing, employment and services, and are unable to access services in the West Bank due to the construction of Israel's separation wall.

JERICHO, Wednesday, August 05, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today uprooted some 100 palm trees in the village of al-Jiftlik north of Jericho city in the Jordan Valleys, a local municipal source said.
Mayor of al-Jiftlik Ahmad Abu Ghanem told WAFA that the Israeli forces uprooted and seized some 100 palm trees in the area of al-Shuna.
The landlord was identified as Anwar Abu Joudeh, who planted the trees.
Horizontally located 33 kilometers to the north of Jericho, al-Jiftlik has a population of some 5,500, who predominantly depend on agriculture and livestock for their main source of livelihood. The villages occupies a total area of 185,032 dunums. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, Israel maintains full control over the village, classified as Area C, and has allowed the villagers to build within a small pocket of 972 dunams, which accounts for 0.005 of the total village area.
Israel has severely restricted Palestinian access to water in the area, particularly the 23 underground wells used for agriculture. Local water springs are susceptible to dryness and depletion as a result of Israel’s control over water. 
The Israeli water company of Mekorot has depleted the wells and has been granted monopoly on the excavation, restoration, distribution and selling of water. In contrast, Palestinians have been forbidden from constructing new wells and restoring existing ones.
Israel has seized at least some 6,750 dunams belonging to the village for the construction of seven nearby colonial settlements, 4,550 dunums for the construction of a military base, besides to more land for opening settler-only by-pass Roads No. 90, 50, 505 and 508, and constructing colonial outposts, pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

"Animal sheds destroyed as demolition orders were issued against structures in south of West Bank""",8/4/20 13:36,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118743,"
BETHLEHEM/HEBRON, Tuesday, August 4, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities today demolished animal sheds in a village east of Bethlehem, as owners of tin structures in the south of the West Bank, were told their shelters will be demolished, according to sources.
Ahmad Ghazal, deputy head of Kisan village council, east of Bethlehem, told WAFA that an Israeli occupation force raided the village this morning with a bulldozer and proceeded to demolish animal shelters used by two local residents under the pretext of building without a permit.
He said the owners were informed only yesterday of the demolition order and given only 24 hours to empty them of their contents or they will be arrested.
Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation authority said today that it is going to expropriate 327 dunums of Kisan village land in order to expand the illegal settlement of Aibi Hanahal, built on village land, according to Hasan Breijieh, from the Wall and Settlements Resistance Committee.
He said Israel, which intends to build 224 new housing units in the illegal settlement, has been demolishing Palestinian homes in the area to clear it for its settlement expansion policy.
In the Masafer Yatta village of Shaab al-Batem, south of the West Bank, the Israeli army informed four residents of the intention to demolish their tin structures used to shelter their families under the pretext they were built without a permit, according to Rateb al-Jabour, coordinator for the Wall and Settlements Resistance Committee in the Hebron area.
He said that 20 people will be displaced if the demolition takes place.
Jabour said Israel is seeking to empty that area of its Palestinian residents in order to expand the illegal settlement of Avigal, built on expropriated Palestinian land.
He also said that the Israeli occupation has ordered today stop work on two tin homes and an animal barn in Sussiya village, in Masafer Yatta, with a goal to empty the village of its Palestinian residents in order to expand the nearby illegal settlement of Sossia.

JERUSALEM, Tuesday, August 04, 2020 (WAFA) – Two Palestinian families in occupied East Jerusalem were forced yesterday to tear down their homes at orders of the Israeli occupation municipality of West Jerusalem, according to a local activist.
Khaled Abu Tayeh, member of the Silwan Land Defense Committee, said Iyad Abu Sbeih demolished his family home in Silwan neighborhood and Issa Illan Oweisat demolished his home in Jabal al-Mukabber neighborhood.
The Israeli municipality issued demolition orders against the Abu Sbeih and Oweisat homes under the pretext they were built without a permit and gave them a choice of either tearing their homes down by themselves or the municipality will demolish them and force them to pay exorbitant amounts in fines and costs.
Two other Silwan residents, Samir and his brother Suleiman al-Qaq, started yesterday emptying their two apartments of their furniture in order to self-demolish them to avoid paying the high cost of demolition if done by the Israeli occupation municipality.
Palestinians in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem say they are forced to build without a permit on their land because getting one is an almost impossible task. At the same time, the Israeli occupation authorities build thousands of new housing units in illegal Jewish-only settlements built on expropriated Palestinian land in East Jerusalem.

"Occupation authorities order confiscation of 200 dunums of West Bank land""",8/3/20 17:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118735,"
BETHLEHEM, Monday, August 03, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli occupation authorities ordered today the confiscation of about 200 dunums of Palestinian private-owned land near the village of Kisan, east of Bethlehem city in the occupied West Bank, said a local source.
Ahmad Ghazal, deputy mayor of the village, told WAFA that a force of the Israeli occupation army broke into al-Tina area in the village, and notified local citizens that the 200 dunums of land was confiscated for military purposes. The army also told the citizens that they are denied entry into the confiscated land.
In the meantime, the occupation army handed a notice to a local citizen informing him that they are intending to demolish a livestock barn of his own, under the pretext of construction without a permit.
Kisan, inhabited by around 800 Palestinian villagers, is surrounded by two Israeli settlements, and over half of the total area of the village has in recent years been confiscated by the occupation authorities for the benefit of the colonial Israeli settlement enterprise.
The village is located in an area classified as Area C, under full Israeli military and civil control, and where Israeli occupation authorities ban almost most kinds of urban development for Palestinians, which is not the case for the Israeli settler population who enjoy a full access to all services and at no tax.

"Over 27,000 Palestinians attend Eid al-Adha prayers at Al-Aqsa""",7/31/20 11:55,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118718,"
 
JERUSALEM, Friday, July 31, 2020 (WAFA) – Over 27,000 Palestinian Muslim worshipers today attended Eid al-Adha prayers at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, said WAFA correspondent.
The worshipers made their way in the early morning hours to the mosque compound to attend the prayers of Eaid al-Adha, the “Festival of the Sacrifice” in English, which is the second of two globally celebrated holidays in Islam, as Israel, the occupying power, imposed a partial lockdown to battle the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In his sermon, the Grant Mufti of Jerusalem Sheikh Muhammad Hussein stressed that the mosque compound solely belongs to Muslims, and should not be shared with any “aggressor” or “tyrant”.
He added that the Palestinian people had no alternative but to unite in order to defend their holy sites and territories against foreign occupation.
As part of the precautionary measures to battle the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, worshipers had to wear face masks, maintain physical distancing and bring their own prayer rugs.
This came as settler “Temple Mount” groups urged their followers to force their way into the holy site to commemorate Tisha B’Av Day.  
Yesterday, Israeli police detained six Palestinians from inside the mosque compound and assaulted others as groups of settlers barged into it under military control.
In last May, the mosque compound was shuttered on Eid al-Fitr as part of the precautionary measures to curb the spread of the pandemic. 
For many Palestinians in Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territory, Ramadan is directly connected to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which sits just above the Western Wall plaza, houses both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosque. 
The third holiest site in Islam, it is also venerated as Judaism's most holy place, as it sits where Jews believe the First and Second Temples once stood.
While Jewish visitation is permitted to the compound, non-Muslim worship at Al-Aqsa is prohibited according to an agreement signed between Israel and the Jordanian government after Israel’s illegal occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967.
However, right-wing Jewish groups calling for the destruction of the mosque and the construction of a Jewish temple on the site have repeatedly entered the area under heavy police escort.
The visits, combined with proposals for a Knesset vote to divide the site between Jews and Muslims, have outraged the Palestinian public, which sees the encroachment on Al-Aqsa as symptomatic of the wider denial of their rights in historic Palestine as well as intense discrimination in housing, employment, and social services by Israeli authorities.
Al-Aqsa is located in East Jerusalem, a part of the internationally recognized Palestinian territories that have been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967.

"Palestinians demonstrate outside an Israeli court in support of Jerusalem’s PA governor""",7/30/20 11:39,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118710,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, July 30, 2020 (WAFA) – Several Palestinians and Arab members of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, demonstrated today outside the Israeli Magistrate Court in West Jerusalem in support of detained Palestinian Authority governor of Jerusalem Adnan Ghaith.
Speaking to the crowd, lawmaker Ahmad Tibi, from the Arab Joint List, said the arrest of Ghaith and other Palestinian activists in the occupied city “aims at intimidating and preventing any Palestinian activity in Jerusalem, which is occupied and not united.”
He added, “We are here to challenge and to support all Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.”
Police detained two of the protesters, interrogated them and held them for a while.

"In violation of the status quo, Israeli police allows fanatic Jews to hold rituals at the Islamic Al-Aqsa Mosque""",7/30/20 10:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118707,"
JERUSALEM, Thursday, July 30, 2020 (WAFA) – In violation of the status quo, Israeli police today allowed Jewish fanatics to openly perform religious rituals on the premises of Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third holiest site, in Jerusalem’s old city, according to witnesses.
They said the fanatics, who were marking a Jewish event, held public prayer at Bab al-Rahma (Golden Gate) area inside the Islamic holy compound during the daily visit hours.
When Muslim worshippers attempted to block the fanatics from holding their prayers since they infringe on the sanctity of the Muslim holy place, Israeli police, which often accompanies the fanatics during their so-called visit, attacked them and detained at least five people.
The Jewish fanatic groups have called on their followers to be present at Al-Aqsa Mosque today, which also marks the eve of the Muslim Eid Al-Adha holiday, to mark the Jewish event. At the same time, Muslims have called on people to be present at the mosque to protect it from the Jewish fanatics.

"Israel to demolish entire Palestinian village in north of West Bank, displacing 200 people""",7/29/20 20:58,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118703,"
JENIN, Wednesday, July 29, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities are going to demolish an entire Palestinian village in the north of the West Bank displacing over 200 people, today said the head of the village council.
Mahmoud Amarneh, head of Farasin village council west of Jenin, told WAFA that Israeli occupation forces raided the village this morning and handed out 36 demolition orders for the entire structures and water wells in the village where 200 people live.
He said the military told the residents that the demolition will take place in few days.
Amarneh said the Israeli occupation government wants to take over the village in order to expand illegal settlements built in that area.
The village has a 200-year old well and several ancient buildings, he said, urging international intervention to prevent Israel from committing a massacre in the village.

"Israel confiscates tractors from several Jordan Valley villages""",7/29/20 14:18,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118699,"
 
JORDAN VALLEY, Wednesday, July 29, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today confiscated three Palestinian-owned farming tractors from several villages in the Jordan Valley, said a local activist.
Aref Daraghmeh, a local human rights activist, said that Israeli forces barged their way into Marj Na‘ja, Marj al-Ghazal and Az-Zubeidat villages, where they confiscated at least three farming tractors.
Under international law, driving residents of an occupied territory from their homes is considered forcible transfer of protected persons, which constitutes a war crime. But residents of Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley are no strangers to such disruptive Israeli policies.
The valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

"Israel demolishes house under construction in Hebron-district town""",7/29/20 14:08,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118698,"
 
HEBRON, Wednesday July 29, 2020 (WAFA) - Israeli forces Wednesday morning demolished the foundations of a house under construction in Beit Awwa town, south of Hebron city in the southern occupied West Bank, said WAFA correspondent.
He confirmed that Israeli forces raided the town, and demolished the foundation of the 150-meter-quare house purportedly for being built without a permit.
The homeowner was identified as Mu‘ath Swaiti.
Swaiti told WAFA that he received a military stop-construction notice, and his family appealed to an Israeli court to overturn the demolition order.
We were surprised to see the demolition taking place although no court ruling was issued in this regard.
According to a report by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, the Israeli High Court could be liable for war crimes for their policies that led to the dispossession of Palestinians from their properties in Area C of the West Bank.
The report, Fake Justice, shows that the court’s support of Israeli planning policy is tantamount to support for dispossession and forcible transfer of Palestinians, a war crime under international law.
Israel demolishes Palestinian houses and structures almost on a daily basis as a means to achieve “demographic control” of the occupied territories.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining rarely-granted permits to provide shelters for their families.
In contrast, Israel argues that building within existing colonial settlements is necessary to accommodate the “natural growth” of settlers. Therefore, it much more easily gives the estimated 550,000 Jewish Israeli settlers there building permits and provides them with roads, electricity, water and sewage systems that remain inaccessible to many neighboring Palestinians.

"Palestinian cultural centers call on rights organizations, UNESCO, EU to denounce Israeli raid of their Jerusalem premises""",7/28/20 20:38,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118691,"
 
JERUSALEM, Tuesday, July 28, 2020 (WAFA) - Yabous Cultural Centre and the Jerusalem Society for Music Education (the National Conservatory of Music) today called on human rights organization, UNESCO and the European Union to strongly denounce Israeli police raid of their premises in occupied East Jerusalem last week and to support the right of these and other Palestinian organizations and scholars in the city to function freely without Israeli interference.
A squad of Israeli police and income tax personnel raided last Wednesday morning the home of the director of the Jerusalem Society for Music Education, Suhail Khoury, and his wife Rania Elias, the director of Yabous Cultural Center.
Their children were held in one room while the police searched their bedroom and confiscated their passports, documents, computers, phones, and car after which they led Rania to the Yabous Center and Suhail to the interrogation center in Jabal Abu Ghneim.
Concurrently a squad of Israeli police and income tax personnel raided the Conservatory and Yabous premises and the home of Daoud al Ghoul, the ex-director of Shafaq- a network of cultural organizations in Jerusalem, where they confiscated documents, files, computers, and CCTV equipment. Rania was then taken to the interrogation center at Abu Ghneim where she and Suhail remained under interrogation until the evening after which they were released on bail. Al-Ghoul was detained.
""The Boards of the two organizations denounce the police statement on Wednesday 22/7/2020 which falsely charges the two directors and attempts to blemish the reputation of those two outstanding cultural organizations which are overseen by reputed volunteers, executive boards and are manned by capable directors and staff members,"" said a statement by the two Palestinian cultural organizations. ""The integrity and commitment of the directors and staff members to the mission of promoting culture and offering the public productions of high quality for decades, have earned them the confidence of the community.""
The statement said the boards also ""denounce the confiscation of documents and computers and the manner in which the home of the Khoury's was raided which terrorized their children.""
Both cultural organizations refuted all the Israeli charges and allegations, carried under the pretext of an “Experiment” according to the statement of the Israeli Ministry of Justice, especially since their financial accounts are audited by the renowned international auditing firms PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC and Deloitte.
""Both Yabous and the National Conservatory of Music call on all human rights organizations and UNESCO as well as the European Union and representatives of consulates and diplomats to support these organizations in Jerusalem and to hold to account the occupying forces for their daily violations of the rights of the Palestinians and their organizations and to stop all attacks on scholars, artists and musicians and those involved in the cultural life,"" said the statement.
Yabous Cultural Center is considered the main and the largest in the city that holds cultural events and artistic activities including music, dance, theater, poetry and literature as well as cinema, and serves various age groups and mainly youth.
The National Conservatory of Music is a prominent music school that teaches classical music to children and organizes concerts around the year. The school manages choirs, music ensembles and orchestras.

"Israel to demolish two homes, halts work on two barns east of Hebron""",7/28/20 14:57,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118686,"
 
HEBRON, Tuesday, July 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today issued military demolition orders against two houses and  a stop-construction order against two barns in the village of Birin, to the east of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.
WAFA correspondent confirmed that Israeli forces handed Fayez al-Azazma a demolition order against his 120-meter-square house and gave Isma‘eel Barqan another order against his 150-meter-quare house.
Soldiers also issued a military order to halt the construction of two livestock barns; a 200-meter-square barn belonging to Emran Barqan and a 400-meter-square another belonging to Yousef al-Ajlouny.
The villagers voiced their concerns that the planned demolitions are part of the wider Israeli measures designed to displace them and grab their land to make room for the expansion of the nearby illegal colonial settlement of Bani Haiver.
They called on local and international organizations to help revoke Israel's demolition and displacement decisions and to protect them against settler violence.
According to the Land Research Center, Israel has frequently issued military stop-construction and demolition orders against various residential and agricultural structures and dismantled barns in the locality, citing the lack of rarely-issued construction permits as a pretext.
In December 2017, Israel delivered stop-construction orders to the locality’s sole clinic and building intended to serve as a primary school for the community’s 60 children
In June 2019, as showed in a PLO’s Negotiations Affairs Department’s report, Israel seized 4,800 dunams of land from several localities, including Birin, for the expansion of Bani Haiver.
Located to the southwest of Bani Na‘im, Birin has a population of 160 and is flanked by Bani Haiver colonial settlement from the east and the settler-only bypass Road No. 60 from the west. Its residents were originally expelled from Naqab in southern Israel and now depend on agriculture and livestock as their main source of livelihood.

Member of the Local Follow-up Committee Mohammad Abu al-Humms told WAFA that police and staff of the Israeli Jerusalem municipality escorted bulldozers into the area, where the heavy machineries razeed some 14 donums of land in the northern and southeastern part of the neighborhood.
He added that the bulldozers demolished five shacks; including two livestock shacks and a horse shack, and seized three sheep. 
Some of the demolished structures belong to the Abu al-Humms and Darwish families.
Wadi Hilweh Information Center, a Silwan-based monitor, posted a video showing police confiscating three sheep that the neighborhood residents prepared for the upcoming Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.
Another video show police and municipal staff cordoning off the area as the bulldozers proceeded with the demolition.
For the residents of Issawiya, a Palestinian village of some 20,000 people, and other parts of occupied East Jerusalem, military raids, land grab and demolitions are a daily reality.
The village is plagued by poor infrastructure, residents are constantly harassed by the Israeli Border Police and anyone, including children, runs the risk of arbitrary arrest.
Using the pretext of illegal building, Israel demolishes houses on a regular basis to restrict Palestinian expansion in occupied Jerusalem.
At the same time, the municipality and government build tens of thousands of housing units in illegal settlements in East Jerusalem for Jews with a goal to offset the demographic balance in favor of the Jewish settlers in the occupied city.

"Israeli forces demolish carwash south of Bethlehem""",7/28/20 13:51,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118684,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Tuesday, July 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today demolished a carwash and seized all of its equipment and contents in al-Khader town, south of the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, a local source said.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem Hasan Breijeh told WAFA that Israeli soldiers raided Um Rukba area, south of the town, and demolished the carwash and seized all of its contents, purportedly for being built without a permit.
Owner of the carwash was identified as Ahmad al-Seer.
Breijieh noted that al-Seer was previously given a military demolition notice by Israeli authorities in March.
Located 4 kilometers to the west of Bethlehem city, al-Khader has a population of some 12,500 and occupies a total area of 8,280 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limited control over a small pocket of land occupying some 1,200dunams, accounting for almost 14.5 percent of the village’s total area.  In contrast, Israel maintains control over the remainder, classified as Area C.
Since the start of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, like so many other villages in Palestine, al-Khader has been subjected to almost continual land theft for Israeli settlements, bypass roads, and military installations. 
Israel has constructed Efrat and NeveDaniyyel colonial settlements on an area of 6,329 dunums of Palestinian land, including a portion confiscated from al-Khader. It has also constructed a section of the apartheid wall, isolating some 5,620 dunums of the town’s land for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
It has confiscated more land for the construction of a tunnel and a crossing, controlling Palestinian movement from Bethlehem city and the western countryside villages.

"Israeli settlers kill over 60 livestock in north of Jericho""",7/28/20 12:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118681,"
 
JERICHO, Tuesday, July 28, 2020 (WAFA) – Over 60 livestock were killed this morning after being poisoned by extremist Israeli settlers in al-Auja  town, north of Jericho city in the Jordan Valley, according to a local source.
Ahmad al-Zawahra, the livestock owner, told WAFA that a group of settlers sprayed poison on the pastures where his livestock graze, killing more than 60 of them.
Meanwhile, Head of al-Auja Municipality’s Water Department Jihad Shabnat said that it was highly likely that the number would increase as some of the remaining livestock are still in a critical condition.
Settler violence against Palestinians and their property is routine in the West Bank and is rarely prosecuted by Israeli authorities.
Settlers' violence includes property and mosque arsons, stone-throwing, uprooting of crops and olive trees, attacks on vulnerable homes, among others.
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in colonial settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The Jordan Valley, which is a fertile strip of land running west along the Jordan River, is home to about 65,000 Palestinians and makes up approximately 30% of the West Bank.
Since 1967, when the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel has transferred at least 11,000 of its Jewish citizens to the Jordan Valley. Some of the settlements in which they live were built almost entirely on private Palestinian land.
The Israel military has also designated about 46 percent of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone since the beginning of the occupation in June 1967, and has been utilizing the pretext of military drills to forcefully displace Palestinian families living there as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and stifling Palestinian development in the area.
Approximately 6,200 Palestinians live in 38 communities in places earmarked for military use and have had to obtain permission from the Israeli authorities to enter and live in their communities.
In violation of international law, the Israeli military not only temporarily displaces the communities on a regular basis, but also confiscates their farmlands, demolishes their homes and infrastructure from time to time.
Besides undergoing temporary displacement, the Palestinian families living there face a myriad restrictions on access to resources and services. Meanwhile, Israel exploits the resources of the area and generates profit by allocating generous tracts of land and water resources for the benefit of settlers.
Israeli politicians have made it clear on several occasions that the highly strategic Jordan Valley would remain under their control in any eventuality.

RAMALLAH, Monday, July 27, 2020 (WAFA) – Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and other Palestinian officials today condemned Israeli settlers’ arson of a mosque in the West Bank city of al-Bireh, describing it as a criminal and racist act.
Israeli settlers sneaked into al-Bireh from the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Psagot and set parts of a local mosque on fire while writing racist graffiti on its walls such as “siege to the Arabs,” and “this land is for the Jews.”
Shtayyeh said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting held in Ramallah that the arson is considered a criminal act while holding the Israeli government responsible for it.
“This is a criminal and racist act and we hold the occupation authority fully responsible for it and for the unruly acts and growing violence of the settlers,” he said.
The Foreign Ministry has also condemned the arson saying it takes very serious attacks on places of worship.
“The Ministry, while taking the settlers’ attacks against places of worship very seriously, holds the Israeli government and its prime minister fully and directly responsible for this attack,” it said in a statement.
Secretary-general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saeb Erekat, called the arson “racism and apartheid.”

"Palestinian babies denied by the Israeli occupation authorities the right to travel with their mothers""",7/27/20 11:15,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118665,"
RAMALLAH, Monday, July 27, 2020 (WAFA) – The Israeli occupation authorities yesterday denied two Palestinian women the right to leave the West Bank via the crossing with Jordan with their newly born babies under the pretext the babies were not registered in Israel despite the fact they are West Bank Palestinian citizens, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates.
It said in a statement that the two babies were registered with their mothers’ documents by the Palestinian Ministry of Interior, but that when the two women arrived at the Israeli-controlled Allenby/King Hussein/al-Karama crossing with Jordan, the Israeli occupation authorities turned them back under the pretext the babies were not registered in the Israeli population registration as well.
Before ending all coordination with the occupying power, Israel, on May 19 following Israel’s decision to annex a large chunk of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority (PA) used to submit to Israel documents about children born in the West Bank or Gaza to include them in the Israeli population registration as they are being added to the identity cards of their parents and issued Palestinian passports. However, with the PA suspending all agreements with Israel and ending coordination with in protest to its annexation plans, this process, as all coordination steps, has stopped.
The Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the Israeli denial for a travel right to the two mothers and their babies to be reunited with their husbands who work in the United Arab Emirate after coming home to give birth before returning to join their husbands.
“This stance by the occupation state is a violation and an infringement of the Geneva Conventions, which guarantee freedom of movement of people under occupation, particularly since the two women carry valid documents for themselves and their babies issued by the State of Palestine, which is under occupation,” said Ahmad al-Dik, from the Foreign Ministry.

"For fifth week, thousands of Israeli demonstrators demand Netanyahu to step down""",7/26/20 12:14,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118656,"
JERUSALEM, Sunday, July 26, 2020 (WAFA) - Thousands of Israeli protesters demonstrated in occupied Jerusalem and across Israel for the fifth week last night, demanding long-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down over corruption charges as well as his failure to handle the coronavirus pandemic.
In occupied Jerusalem, demonstrators marched through the Paris Square and outside Netanyahu's residence, where mass anti-Netanyahu protests were witnessed in recent weeks. An Israeli occupation police spokesman told Israeli reporters that around 5,000 demonstrators were at the site of the protest which began at around 8 pm and continued until 11 pm.
Protests were also staged in Tel Aviv, Caesarea and other locations, especially at major junctions, highway overpasses and other areas across the country, in what appeared to be the largest yet demonstration of a growing protest movement seeking Netanyahu’s resignation.
In Jerusalem’s Paris Square, which has been the center of the protest movement, police allowed protesters to remain until around 1 a.m. but then began forcing them out, dragging activists off the street one by one and eventually deploying two water cannons against the remaining group that refused to leave.
Following what some have described as a hasty reopening of the country's economy in May, new daily infections in Israel have spiked to an average of 2,000 a day.

"Settlers set olive trees on fire south of Nablus""",7/25/20 16:22,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118648,"
NABLUS, Saturday, July 25, 2020 (WAFA) – Dozens of illegal Jewish settlers entered today an agricultural land near the village of Huwara, south of Nablus city in the occupied West Bank, and set fire to Palestinian-owned olive and almond trees, according to local sources. 
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors settlement activities in the area, told WAFA that a group of settlers set fire to agricultural land belonging to farmers from the village, destroying olive and almond trees as fire flames engulfed the land.
Illegal Israeli settlers are notorious for violence against Palestinians and their property, and are almost never prosecuted by the occupation authorities.
There are about 750,000 illegal Israeli settlers living in Jewish-only settlements across the occupied Palestinian Territory, in blatant disregard of international law and the Fourth Geneva Conventions.

"Settlers storm picturesque holiday destination in Nablus district""",7/24/20 15:06,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118638,"
 
NABLUS, Friday, July 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today stormed al-Badhan village, a picturesque springtime holiday destination, northeast of Nablus city, said a municipal source.
Mayor of al-Badhan Emad Salahat said that some 30 Israeli settlers barged their way into Wadi al-Badhan, a famous springtime holiday destination, where they remained for two hours and left.
The settlers came from the nearby colonial settlement of Elon Moreh, located atop the mountain overlooking al-Badhan village.
Salahat warned of settler attacks against the villagers, whom were forced at gun point to allow settler access to the natural parks.
Wadi al-Badhan is considered one of the most beautiful natural landscapes in Palestine given its abundance of water springs, greenery, cool air and high biodiversity.
According to the Applied Research Institute of Jerusalem (ARIJ), settlers from this colonial settlement frequently attack the village, including illegally dumping their wastewater and discharging their sewage water onto the village land, this polluting the villagers’ crops and trees.
The settlement has an industrial area which contains an aluminum factory, a food canning factory and a cloth dying factory all of which have high volumes of pollutant waste water which is hazardous to the natural environment.
The village of al-Badhan is named after the valley and has a population of about 4,000. Tourists and travellers often visit the village’s numerous archaeological sites, including 12 ancient watermills.

"Israel orders halt on construction of three houses in Bethlehem-district village""",7/24/20 13:44,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118636,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Friday, July 24, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces today delivered stop-construction orders for three houses in Beit Sakariya village, south of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, said a local activist.
Director of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission Hassan Briejah confirmed to WAFA correspondent that Israeli forces and officers of the so-called Israeli Civil Administration raided the village, and handed military stop-construction orders for three houses purportedly for lacking rarely-issued licenses. 
The houses slated for demolition belong to Mohammad Atallah’s family. 
Breijah added that the planned demolitions are part of Israel’s policy to limit the village’s urban expansion and seize its land to make room for the expansion of nearby Israeli colonial settlements. 
Located nine kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Beit Sakariya, also known as Khirbet Beit Zakariya, has a population of some 150 and occupies a total area of 6,735 dunams. 
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, 100 percent of the village was classified as Area C, which falls under full Israeli control. 
The village lies in the heart of the Israeli colonial settlement cluster, part of which comprises the Gush Etzion colonial settlement bloc. That’s why the villagers often suffer from the ongoing attacks and provocations of Israeli settlers, who attempt to seize their lands, uproot their trees and destroy their houses with the help of the Israeli military.
Israel has established six colonial settlements on land confiscated from the village. It has confiscated 2,350 dunams of the village land, accounting for 35 percent of the village total land. Israel has seized some 200 dunams for the establishment of a military camp, and further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass Road no. 60, 367 and 3698, which all extend for 4.5 kilometers on the village land. 
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, isolating some 6724 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 99 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.

BETHLEHEM, Thursday, July 23, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces delivered this morning military demolition and stop-construction orders against several structures in al-Walaja village, west of Bethlehem city, said a local source.
Ibrahim Awadallah, a local activist, said Israeli forces delivered military orders to stop the construction and demolish three houses in Jabal al-Rwisat area of the village, purportedly for being built without licenses.
The owners of the houses slated for demolition were given time to carry out the demolition by themselves or risk paying exorbitant demolition costs if done by the army.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops stormed Khallat Samak area in the village, where they handed military orders to stop the construction and demolish a water well and livestock barns.
Yesterday, similar orders were issued against a house under construction and four agricultural rooms in the same village.
Located west of Bethlehem, 97 percent of the area of al-Walaja village is isolated by a section of Israel’s apartheid wall. The majority of this land is agricultural land, forests and open spaces.
The village is flanked by two illegal Israeli colonial settlements - Gilo from the east and Har Gilo from the south.

RAMALLAH, Wednesday, July 22, 2020 (WAFA) - The raid by Israeli forces of various Palestinian cultural centers in occupied Jerusalem “is the latest of a long history of targeting everything Palestinian in our occupied capital,” and aims to erase the Palestinian presence in the city, today said Hanan Ashrawi, member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Today, Israeli occupation forces raided the Yabous Cultural Centre and The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in East Jerusalem and confiscated documents and equipment, after detaining the centers' directors Rania Elias and Suheil Khoury from their home. Additionally, Israeli forces wreaked havoc in the home of the director of SHAFAQ Jerusalem Arts Network, Daoud Al-Ghoul. 
“Israel's violent and systematic campaign against Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem aims to erase the Palestinian presence and alter the demographic and cultural make-up of the city through numerous home demolitions, forced evictions and targeting the daily livelihoods of Palestinian Jerusalemites,” said Ashrawi in a statement. “It has recently and repeatedly detained Palestinian officials such as the Governor of Jerusalem Adnan Ghaith and Jerusalem Minister Fadi al-Hidmi as well as civilians and activists on a daily basis.”
The PLO official stressed that the international community should hold Israel accountable for its actions.
“Accountability for Israel is certainly long overdue. The international community should muster the courage to translate its statements into concrete action in order to stop constant Israeli crimes and violations,” said Ashrawi, calling on UNESCO and its Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, “to fulfill its mandate in Palestine to protect Palestinian culture and heritage.""

NABLUS, Wednesday, July 22, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli settlers today blocked a main road in the north of the West Bank and attacked Palestinian vehicles travelling on that road, according to a local activist.
Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli settlement activities in the north of the West Bank, said settlers used the blocked road to attack cars stuck on it with stones, causing damage to some and threatening the life of their occupants.

JERUSALEM, Wednesday, July 22, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli police today stormed two Palestinian-run cultural centers in the occupied city of Jerusalem and seized document, said local sources.
They said Israeli police and intelligence officers stormed the East Jerusalem residence of Rania Elias, director of Yabous Cultural Center, and Suheil Khoury, director of Edward Said National Conservatory of Music (ESNCM), and escorted them to the center and the conservatory located in the heart of East Jerusalem’s business district, searched them thoroughly, ransacked them and seized records and other documents.
Elias and Khoury were also detained by police.
Police also stormed and ransacked the house of Daoud al-Ghoul, director of Jerusalem Arts Network – Shafaq, which is a network of five Palestinian art centers based in East Jerusalem that includes Yabous, ESNCM, Al-Ma’mal Foundation for Contemporary Art; Palestinian Art Court-Al Hosh, and the Palestinian National Theatre - Al-Hakawati.
The Palestinian Ministry of Culture strongly condemned the Israeli police raid against the cultural centers in Jerusalem and the detention of two of their directors.
“The attack on these institutions is an attack on the Palestinian national culture and cultural heritage,” said the Ministry in a statement.
Israeli police have recently intensified their campaign against all Palestinian institutions and activists in the occupied city, closing most them of them and detaining leaders in an effort to prevent any Palestinian activity in the city.
“First and foremost, ESNCM works in Education. Over a thousand students currently study music on the Academic Programs in the ESNCM’s six branches in Jerusalem, Nablus, Gaza, Ramallah, Bethlehem and the Tchaikovsky Music School.  Both Arabic and Western music are taught, and the students receive individual instrumental lessons, theoretical classes and ensemble tuition as well as choir, Arabic percussion and music history,” according to the conservatory’s website.
“Yabous is a non-governmental Palestinian organization based in Jerusalem. Yabous was established in 1995 when a number of artists and culture enthusiasts and entrepreneurs from Jerusalem decided to create a body to adopt the development and patronage of performing arts in Jerusalem,” said the Yabous website.

"Israeli navy attack Gaza fishermen """,7/22/20 12:52,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118606,"
Gaza, Wednesday, July 22, 2020 (WAFA) –  Israeli navy Wednesday morning opened fire towards Palestinian fishermen sailing offshore As-Sudaniya, northwest of Gaza city, WAFA correspondent reported.
He confirmed that the fishermen were sailing only three nautical miles offshore the area when Israeli naval boats opened gunfire and water hoses towards them.
The fishermen had to leave the water and abruptly end their fishing mission, which is their sole source of livelihood. No injuries were reported though.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces manning the border fence fired gunshot and tear gas at a group of farmers who were tending to their groves to the east of al-Zaytoun neighborhood, southeast of Gaza city. 
The farmers were forced to leave their groves and no injuries were reported among them.
Fourteen years following the Israeli “disengagement” from Gaza, Israel has not actually disengaged from Gaza; it still maintains control of its land borders, access to the sea and airspace.
Two million Palestinians live the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to a punishing and crippling Israeli blockade for 12 years and repeated onslaughts that have heavily damaged much of the enclave’s infrastructure.
Gaza’s 2-million population remains under “remote control” occupation and a strict siege, which has destroyed the local economy, strangled Palestinian livelihoods, plunged them into unprecedented rates of unemployment and poverty, and cut off from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and the wider world.
Gaza remains occupied territory, having no control over its borders, territorial waters or airspace. Meanwhile, Israel upholds very few of its responsibilities as the occupying power, failing to provide for the basic needs of Palestinian civilians living in the territory.
Every two in three Palestinians in Gaza is a refugee from lands inside what is now Israel. That government forbids them from exercising their right to return as enshrined in international law because they are not Jews.

HEBRON, Tuesday, July 21, 2020 (WAFA) – An Israeli army bulldozer demolished today a carwash shop belonging to a Palestinian resident in the town of Beit Ummar to the north of Hebron, the southern occupied West Bank, according to a local activist.
Mohammad Awad told WAFA Israeli forces knocked down a newly-constructed carwash shop located adjacent to Jerusalem-Hebron street to the east of Beit Ummar. 
The owner said he received an order to demolish the 200-square-meters shop almost a week ago and was surprised by the demolition today. It was built almost a month ago.

HEBRON, Tuesday, July 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli military today demolished tin-sheet structures in Birin, one of the localities comprising Bani Naim town, east of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, said a local activist.
Coordinator of the Anti-Wall and Settlement Committees Rateb al-Jabour said Israeli forces escorted a bulldozer into the locality where it tore down two shacks, each has an area of 80 square meters, displacing two families, including children.
Jabour pointed out Israel was proceeding with demolitions in the locality to displace the villagers and grab their land to expand the nearby colonial settlement of Bani Haiver although the villagers have title deeds.
According to the Land Research Center, Israel has frequently issued military stop-construction and demolition orders against various residential and agricultural structures and dismantled barns in the locality, citing the lack of rarely-issued construction permits as a pretext.
In December 2017, Israel delivered stop-construction orders to the locality’s sole clinic and building intended to serve as a primary school for the community’s 60 children
In June 2019, as showed in a PLO’s Negotiations Affairs Department’s report, Israel seized 4,800 dunums of land from several localities, including Birin, for the expansion of Bani Haiver.
Located to the southwest of Bani Naim, Birin has a population of 160 and is flanked by Bani Haiver colonial settlement from the east and the settler-only bypass Road No. 60 from the west. Its residents were originally expelled from the Naqab in southern Israel and now depend on agriculture and livestock as their main source of livelihood.

"Palestinian house demolished by Israel in northern West Bank town despite presence of a court injunction""",7/21/20 11:07,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118596,"
 
SALFIT, Tuesday, July 21, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces demolished this morning a Palestinian-house in Qarawet Bani Hassan town, west of the northern West Bank city of Salfit, despite an Israeli court injunction, said a local source.
The house owner, identified as Radi Meri, said Israeli soldiers and officers of the so-called Civil Administration, an arm of the Israeli military government, secured the area before a bulldozer proceeded to tear down his 180-square-meter house, which was under construction, purportedly for being built in Area C without a permit.
He added that the demolition was carried out four months after he received a military demolition order.
Meanwhile, Qarawet Bani Hassan Municipality said that it managed to secure with the assistance of the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC) an Israeli court injunction preventing the soldiers from proceeding with the demolition of the Meri house and three other houses in the same area.
It added that the Meri house was already demolished by the time the court order was issued but that the three other houses were spared demolition for the time being.
The houses were being built in Area C, which falls under full Israeli military control.
Israel denies planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing houses to accommodate natural growth, particularly in occupied East Jerusalem and Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the area of the occupied West Bank and falls under full Israeli military rule, forcing residents to build without obtaining permits to provide shelters for their families.

"Jerusalem Governorate condemns Israel's arrest of its PA's governor""",7/20/20 20:43,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118590,"
 
JERUSALEM, Monday, July 20, 2020 (WAFA) – The Jerusalem Governorate today strongly condemned the Israeli occupation authorities’ decision to arrest Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Jerusalem Governor Adnan Ghaith.
Ghaith, who is also s legitimate Palestinian leader and representative in occupied East Jerusalem, was detained Sunday at his home in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan on allegation of working on behalf of the PA in the Israeli-occupied section of the city and taken to the Russian Compound police station in West Jerusalem, where he was kept overnight before being brought to court today for his remand.
The Israeli authorities has lately remanded Gaith, who has been detained over 18 times, and transferred him to investigation cells in Asqalan Prison. Israel continues to restrict the governor's movement, and prevent him from speaking to fellow Palestinian personalities.
“East Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory. According to international law and United Nations resolutions, including UN Resolutions 242, 338 and 2334, Israel's occupation and annexation of the Palestinian territory, including occupied East Jerusalem, is null and void,” the Jerusalem Govenorate said in its statement. 
“Since the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Israel, the occupying power, has attempted and continues to unilaterally and illegally alter the demographic and character of the occupied city. In the absence of accountability and with impunity granted by the US administration, Israel's lawmakers have been intensely launching attacks against Palestinians in Jerusalem, by increasing colonial-settlement expansion in the city and by its continuous denial of their right to self-determination as an integral part of Palestine.”
The Jerusalem Governorate called on representatives of the international community to put pressure on Israel for the immediate release of Gaith. 
“We reiterate our call upon the international community to hold Israel accountable for decades of violations of international humanitarian law and international law, mainly the sacred right of self-determination for the people of Palestine.”

BETHLEHEM, Monday, July 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israel today seized 700 donums of agriculutral land in the vicinity of Jabal al-Fureidis, located to the east of Bethlehem city, according to a local source.
Director off the Anti-Wall and Settlement Commission in Bethlehem Hasan Breijeh said that Israel issued military orders seizing 700 dunams surrounding Jabal al-Fureidis, also known as Herodium, which Israel has appropriated as an Israeli national park.
Israeli forces already fenced the area with barbed wire and installed an iron gate four days ago in favor of the appropriated national park.
The seized land belongs to the al-Wahsh, al-‘Asaker and al-Mas‘da families.
Meanwhile, Israeli bulldozers razed lands belonging to the Bethlehem-district village of Kisan for the seventh day in a row in favor of expanding the illegal colonial settlement of Ibei Hanahal, built on the village's lands.
A number of caravans have been installed near the village as well.
Israel has been using archeology as a key tool in reinforcing its bogus territorial claims to historic Palestine, including “Judea and Samaria”, the Jewish nationalist name used to refer to the occupied West Bank, and give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy. 
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli forces seize rare ancient baptismal font from Bethlehem-district town""",7/20/20 16:56,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118582,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Monday, July 20, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces predawn Monday seized a rare Byzantine-era baptismal font from Tuqu‘ town, southeast of Bethlehem city.
WAFA photojournalist Oday Daibes posted a video showing Israeli soldiers escorting a forklift truck transferring the stone-made font, which dates back to the fifth or sixth century A.D., from the town. 
A documentary prepared by Jerusalem’s Christian Media Center reveals that the rosy font, which weighs approx. eight tons, was part of a local Byzantine-era church.
The font was seen placed for long at the site of the ancient church in Khirbet Tuqu‘, the ancient town of Tuqu‘, before being stolen by unauthorized dealers using a huge forklift in 2000. 
In 2002, Tuqu‘ Municipality managed to retrieve the font and placed it in the vicinity of the mayor’s house, pending the construction of a local museum.
The stolen 1500-year-old receptacle is one of three rare baptismal fonts hewn in rosy rock. The two others include the one recently discovered at the Church of the Nativity and another belonging to Beit Jubrin Church.
Israel has frequently stolen and acquired ancient artifacts from the occupied territories through unauthorized dealers and looters.
Israel has been using archeology as a key tool in reinforcing its bogus territorial claims to historic Palestine, including “Judea and Samaria”, the Jewish nationalist name used to refer to the occupied West Bank, and give them a veneer of historical and religious legitimacy. 
There are almost 834,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Israeli court remands PA’s Jerusalem governor for 7 days""",7/20/20 14:59,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118581,"
JERUSALEM, Monday, July 20, 2020 (WAFA) – An Israeli court remanded in custody the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Jerusalem governor Adnan Ghaith for seven days, according to sources.
Ghaith was detained yesterday at his home in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan on allegation of working on behalf of the Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied section of the city and taken to the Russian Compound police station in West Jerusalem where he was kept overnight before being brought to court today for his remand.
Following his remand, Ghaith was taken to a detention center in Asqalan, in the south of Israel.
This is the 17th time Ghaith has been arrested since he was named by the PA as governor of occupied Jerusalem two years ago. He was also banned from going to the West Bank and talking to Palestinian officials.
Israel exerts all efforts, including detentions, expulsions, closure of institutions, ban on activities, to prevent any Palestinian activity in the occupied city that would undermine its illegal control over East Jerusalem, occupied since June 1967, and which the Palestinians insist is going to be the capital of their future state.

NABLUS, Sunday, July 19, 2020 (WAFA) – Hours after a group of hardcore Israeli settlers torched fields planted with crops near the village of Beita in the north of the occupied West Bank, another group of fanatic settlers torched hundreds of olive trees in the nearby villages of Burin and Madama, according to a local source.
Ghassan Daghlas, in charge of the settlement file in Nablus district, told WAFA that settlers from the illegal settlement of Yitzhar, nearby, torched hundreds of olive trees belonging to Palestinian farmers from the two villages.  
The attack came shortly after hundreds of dunums of agricultural land was set on fire by fanatic settlers in nearby Beita village.
Arson attacks by Israeli settlers increase during the hot summer season when dry grass has grown in many areas surrounding the illegal Jewish-only settlements. These attacks often go unpunished by the Israeli occupation authorities.

"UN: Israel demolished 31 Palestinian structures in past two weeks""",7/17/20 15:46,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/118542,"
RAMALLAH, Friday, July 17, 2020 (WAFA) – During the past two weeks, Israeli occupation authorities demolished or seized 31 Palestinian-owned structures for the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, displacing 13 people and affecting the livelihoods of more than 100 others, today said the UN-OCHA in its biweekly Protection of Civilians Report. 
In the Palestinian Bedouin community of Fasayil, in the Jordan Valley, the Israeli authorities demolished 12 homes and livelihood structures used on a seasonal basis. Another four targeted structures were located in four Bedouin communities in an area allocated for the expansion of the illegal settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. 
The UN organization said two structures were also demolished in the At-Taybeh community, near Hebron, on the basis of Israeli Military Order 1797, in addition to nine other structures in occupied East Jerusalem, including two in al-Isawiya neighborhood, where on 19 February 2020, the Jerusalem municipality announced a six-month freeze in demolitions. 
During the same period, Israeli occupation forces bulldozed agricultural land in two locations in Area C of the Hebron governorate, claiming the area was designated as “state land”. In Al Baq'a, near Hebron city, four dunums of seasonal crops and a retaining wall were bulldozed and destroyed, while next to Sa’ir town, 70 olive trees were uprooted, UN-OCHA added.
Meanwhile, UN-OCHA said five Palestinians were injured, and dozens of trees and vehicles were vandalized by Israeli settlers during the past two weeks. All the injuries occurred in two incidents in Biddya village, near Salfit, when settlers attacked farmers working their land: three were shot with live ammunition, one was physically assaulted, and another bitten by a dog unleashed by settlers. 
Dozens of olive trees were also set on fire by illegal settlers in Burin village, near Nablus, and a few others were uprooted in the As-Seefer community in Hebron, located in the closed area behind the Israeli Segregation Barrier. 
Israeli settlers also raided Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya village, south of Nablus, where they vandalized 12 vehicles, the UN group said.
In the Gaza Strip, the UN-OCHA said on at least 18 occasions, Israeli forces opened warning fire near Israel’s perimeter fence around Gaza, and off its coast, presumably to enforce access restrictions. While no casualties were reported, in one incident, Israeli naval forces arrested four fishermen and confiscated two boats; the fishermen were later released. Also, in two incidents, Israeli forces arrested two Palestinians while they were attempting to enter Israel, one through the fence and, the other, from the sea. On three occasions, Israeli forces entered Gaza and carried out land-levelling and excavation operations near the fence.

Erekat, a resident of Abu Dis, near Jerusalem, was shot dead by Israeli forces at a checkpoint near Bethlehem on 23 June. “Ahmad was shot with lethal force by Israeli soldiers in the absence of necessity and without posing a threat to life or serious injury. He was then left to bleed to death for an hour and a half, while the Israeli occupying forces denied him access to medical care, despite the presence of an Israeli ambulance at the scene. They also prevented a Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance from reaching Ahmad,” said the organizations.
“Under international law, the killing of Ahmad Erekat amounts to an extrajudicial execution and a willful killing, giving rise to individual criminal responsibility as a war crime at the International Criminal Court (ICC),” they said.
Erekat was the 21st Palestinian killed by the Israeli forces throughout the occupied Palestinian territory during the first half of 2020. Less than a month before his killing, the Israeli forces killed Iyad Hallaq in occupied East Jerusalem while he was on his way to a day center for persons with disabilities in the Old City, “in what amounts to an extrajudicial execution, a willful killing, and war crime,” said the organizations.
“The killings of Ahmad Erekat and Iyad Hallaq, as well as countless Palestinians, must be understood within the context of Israel’s widespread and systematic shoot-to-kill policy targeting Palestinians on both sides of the Green Line,” they said.
Al-Haq human rights organization said it has documented an escalation in Israel’s use of lethal force against Palestinians over the past five years, resulting in the killing of 754 Palestinians by the Israeli occupying forces in the occupied Palestinian territory since October 2015. “Israel’s pervasive impunity must be seen as part and parcel of its institutionalized regime of systematic racial oppression and domination over the Palestinian people, which constitutes the crime of apartheid,” said al-Haq.
Since the killing, Erekat’s body has been punitively withheld by the Israeli occupying authorities, as unlawful collective punishment, thereby prolonging his family’s suffering and denying him a dignified burial. The Israeli occupying forces continue to withhold the bodies of 63 Palestinians, under the pretext of using them as “bargaining chips.” In addition, the bodies of at least 253 Palestinians have been languishing, yet to be identified, in Israel’s “cemeteries of numbers.”
In 2016, the UN Committee against Torture considered that the practice of withholding Palestinians’ bodies amounts to prohibited ill-treatment, and called on Israel, the Occupying Power, to “take the measures necessary to return the bodies of the Palestinians that have not yet been returned to their relatives as soon as possible so they can be buried in accordance with their traditions and religious customs, and to avoid that similar situations are repeated in the future.”
Accordingly, the organizations urgently called for international justice and accountability to put an end to Israeli impunity and urged the UN human rights experts to publicly condemn the killing of Ahmad Erekat, to call for the unconditional release of Ahmad’s body as well as the bodies of all Palestinians punitively withheld by the Israeli occupying authorities, and to call on Israel, the Occupying Power, to revise its rules of engagement for the use of live fire.
The organizations also called on the Special Procedures to “Recognize Israel’s systematic shoot-to-kill policy as contributing to the maintenance of Israel’s apartheid regime of systematic racial oppression and domination over the Palestinian people as a whole, which, embedded in a system of impunity, prevents Palestinians from effectively challenging Israel’s apartheid policies and practices.” As stressed by the Erekat family, “These killings are taking place in a broader context of apartheid and settler-colonial expansion.”
Overall, the organizations endorsed calls by the Erekat family for international justice and accountability, including for Israel’s shoot-to-kill policy. They requested that the UN Special Procedures urge third States to activate universal jurisdiction mechanisms to try suspected perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in their own jurisdictions, and to call for “the immediate opening, without any further delay, of a full, thorough, and comprehensive ICC investigation into the Situation in the State of Palestine.”
Finally, the groups urged “Member States and the UN at large to address the root causes prolonging Palestinian oppression, including by bringing an end to Israel’s prolonged occupation and illegal annexation of Jerusalem, lifting the Gaza closure with immediate effect, and dismantling Israel’s apartheid regime over the Palestinian people as a whole, in order to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to return to their homes, lands, and property, as mandated by international law.”
The organizations addressed their appeal to five UN Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism.

"In a new theft of Palestinian land, Israeli settlers fence off a large area in Jordan Valley""",7/14/20 14:20,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/103254,"
 
JORDAN VALLEY, Tuesday, July 14, 2020 (WAFA) – In an attempt to steal Palestinian land, Israeli settlers set up a tent and fenced off dozens of dunums of land in the Jordan Valley, today said Mahdi Daraghme, head of al-Maleh village council.
He said that over the past two days, settlers set up a tent and placed a fence around land in the Bayoud and Umm Kharoubeh villages in the northern Jordan Valley.
The settlers, he explained, have grabbed thousands of dunums of herding land in the Jordan Valley in order to prevent shepherds from reaching them and in order to eventually takeover this land.

"Israeli forces raze large tract of land east of Bethlehem""",7/13/20 21:03,https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/103243,"
 
BETHLEHEM, Monday, July 13, 2020 (WAFA) – Israeli forces razed a large tract of land belonging to Kisan village, east of the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem, said a municipal source.
Deputy mayor of Kisan Ahmad Ghazal confirmed that Israeli forces provided protection to a bulldozer that razed a tract of land covering approx. ten dunams belonging to the village, and installed power poles around it.
He elaborated that land was bulldozed to expand the nearby Israeli colonial settlement outpost of Ibei Hanahal, also written as Ibei Hanachal, established on 166 dunams of land belonging to Kisan in 1999.
Located 11 kilometers to the south of Bethlehem city, Kisan has a population of some 600 and occupies a total area of 133,330 dunams.
Under the Oslo Accords, an agreement made 25 years ago that was supposed to last just five years towards a self-governing country alongside Israel, the Palestinian Authority was given limied control over a tiny pocket of land occupying 112 dunams, accounting for less than 1 percent of the village’s total area.  Israel maintains control over 108,952, classified as Area C, accounting for 81.7 percent. The remaining part of 24,266 dunams, accounting for 18 percent, is classified as nature reserve.
Israel has established three colonial settlements, namely Ma‘ale Amos and Mizpe Shalem besides to the settlement outpost of Ibei Hanahal on lands confiscated from the village. It has confiscated further land for the construction of settler-only by-pass road no. 901 and road no. 3698, which extend for 16.1 kilometers on the village land.
Israel has constructed a section of the apartheid wall, confiscating and isolating some 87,344 dunams of fertile land, accounting for 65.5 percent of the village total area, for colonial settlement activities and pushing the villagers into a crowded enclave, a ghetto, surrounded by walls, settlements and military installations.
